Summary of Supervisor Feedback – Part 1: Background

• Structure: Keep the current structure of the Background section.
• Edits:
• Review long or complex sentences and shorten them for clarity.
• Remove any redundant information to improve focus and flow.
• Make sure each term is framed so readers can follow their relevance throughout the paper.

Summary of Supervisor Feedback – Part 2: Discussion

• General assessment: The Discussion section is strong and contains important elements.
• Structure:
• Begin by introducing the overarching problem (e.g. the burden of cardiovascular risk in prediabetes and type 2 diabetes).
• Describe how your studies and cohorts address this problem, and explain the strength of your arguments based on the data.
• Frame the issue from three key perspectives:
1. Public health perspective – focuses on prevention, early detection, and population-level risk.
2. General practitioner’s perspective – emphasizes relevance to clinical decision-making in primary care.
3. Endocrinologist’s perspective – connects your findings on autonomic dysfunction and cardiovascular risk with specialized care pathways.

• Place your results in the context of these three viewpoints to show their broader relevance and applicability.
• Structural recommendation:
• Keep the current logical structure:
1. Start with the main message.
2. Follow with a discussion of biological mechanisms.
3. End with a section on re-stratification (i.e. using your findings to refine risk categorization or improve targeted prevention).
• Practical recommendation:
• End with a short recommendation on how heart rate variability (HRV) and cardiovascular autonomic reflex tests (CARTs) can be used to better address cardiovascular risk:
• Emphasize that different measures serve different purposes:
• HRV may be more suitable for early detection and population screening due to its continuous and non-invasive nature.
• CARTs may be more appropriate for clinical risk stratification and confirming autonomic dysfunction in high-risk individuals.
• Highlight that combining these tools can strengthen personalized risk prediction and guide earlier intervention in both public health and clinical settings.

Summary of Supervisor Feedback – Part 3: CanCan Study (Manuscript Preparation)
• Immediate tasks:
• You need to send Sina a version of the manuscript by tomorrow.
• The manuscript should be submitted within two weeks.
• Target journal:
• You’re aiming to submit to Diabetes Care.
• Format the text according to Diabetes Care’s author guidelines.
• Key message:
• Be explicit about the added predictive value of CAN when incorporated into the WatchGM score.
• Also, be transparent about its limitations and potential issues.
• This clarification is especially important for Odeka, so make sure these points are clearly addressed in the manuscript.
