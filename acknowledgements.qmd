# Acknowledgements {.unnumbered}

This PhD journey has been a remarkable adventure. The best part has undoubtedly been all the people I have met and worked with along the way. I would like to express my deepest gratitude to colleagues, collaborators, friends, and family for their support throughout this journey and for making the ride both fun and exciting.

First and foremost, I would like to thank my main supervisor, Daniel Witte. His unwavering support, thought-provoking challenges, and brilliant guidance have kept me motivated to learn about diabetes epidemiology throughout this journey. His ability to expand horizons in research has been truly inspiring, and I am deeply grateful for the opportunities to grow under his mentorship. I would also like to thank the rest of the supervisor team: Lasse Bjerg for his methodological support, high spirits, and sharp mind—always cutting straight to the core of the research; Signe T. Andersen for her guidance and support throughout the design and data collection of the CANCAN study. As a non-clinician researcher, it was eye-opening to witness the complex challenges of diabetes consultations, and I admire her ability to understand each patient. Christian Stevns Hansen is also warmly thanked for his prompt support and strong physiological expertise.

Thank you to all my friends at Steno Diabetes Center Aarhus (SDCA) and the Department of Public Health at Aarhus University who have supported my project, inspired great discussions, and shared fun times: Adam, Omar, Luke, Daniel I, Anders, Benjamin, Jie, Livie, Helene, Sidsel, Manuel, Christian, and Ole-Emil.

I would like to thank Marleen van Greevenbroek, Miranda Schram, Carla van der Kallen, and the rest of the team at The Maastricht Study for granting me access to the cohort and for showing me the data collection facilities. Thanks to Marion Feijge for guiding me through the data sets. I am also grateful to Professor Coen Stehouwer for his sharp inputs and deep expertise in diabetes epidemiology. In the ADDITION-PRO study, I would like to thank Anne-Louise Bjerre and Søren Brage for their help in explaining variables, and data manager Marianne at the Department of Public Health for her generous support. In the CANCAN study, I would like to acknowledge Henrik Holm Thomsen and Gitte Jensen for their help with recruitment, and Anne Katrine Møller Gramstrup for extracting clinical data for the study population. I am also deeply grateful to the people who generously agreed to participate in the CANCAN study.

No adventure is truly exciting without cultural exchange—whether through the lovely visits from Peter and Ieva at SDCA or by putting myself in new research environments. To Professor Dianna Magliano and Professor Jonathan Shaw, thank you for including me in the Epidemiology group at the Baker Heart and Diabetes Institute in Melbourne. It was a truly enriching stay, both scientifically and socially. I would like to extend my sincere thanks to Julian Sacre for his valuable support and insightful contributions in deepening my understanding of the challenges involved in diagnosing heart failure subtypes. To the PhD students and post-docs at 7/11, Della, Forough, Elizabeth, Jedidiah, Lei, Mahtab, Kanika and Joanna, thank you for making me feel so welcomed and giving me a wonderful and fun experience of Melbourne.

To my brothers, Esben and Jalte, thank you for putting up with me and for helping me loosen up and have fun. To my parents, thank you for supporting me throughout my life and for standing by me in every path I have chosen. Much of my curiosity for applying mathematics and statistics to understand the world stems from my grandfather, Ebbe Schaarup, who spent countless hours teaching me. Last but not least, to my lovely girlfriend Freja, thank you for always being kind, supportive, and willing to join the adventure.
