    "text": "7.1 Summary of findings\nIn this dissertation, autonomic dysfunction, defined by long-term HRV and standardized CARTs, and its relationship with cardiovascular complications were studied across three different cohorts representing populations at varying levels of prevention and care, including public health, primary care, and secondary care. In The Maastricht Study (Study I), I investigated autonomic dysfunction, measured by 24-hour HRV, and arterial stiffness, measured dynamically along the descending aorta and locally at the carotid site among individuals with NGM, prediabetes, and T2D. Lower HRV was associated with higher aortic and carotid stiffness. This association was evident regardless of glucose metabolism status and was more pronounced in individuals with prediabetes or T2D. The modifying effect of dysglycemia was confirmed by a statistically significant stronger association across higher HbA1c levels. Z-scores of time- and frequency-domain measures showed the strongest associations, primarily driven by HRV indices reflecting total variation in interbeat intervals (SDNN, SDANN, SDNN index, ULF, VLF, TP).\nStudy II focused on individuals at higher risk of developing diabetes, using data from the ADDITION-PRO cohort. In Study II, lower SDNN, measured over multiple days, was associated with 18, 24, and 21 percent higher risk per SD for ischemic-related CVD, hospitalization for heart failure, and all-cause mortality, respectively. The risk became higher at SDNN levels below 120 ms, supported by a greater difference in incidence rates between individuals with 100 ms and 120 ms than the difference observed between individuals with 120 ms and 160 ms. Hourly measures suggested a specific time point related to ischemic-related CVD, as lower SDNN recorded between 6:00 and 7:00 AM was associated with MACE. Adjustment using the residuals method for concurrent heart rate and physical movement did not explain the observed association. Hourly SDNN was associated with all-cause MRR, although no specific time point showed an exceptionally strong association. While no association between hourly SDNN and heart failure was observed, higher heart rate during the night hours from 02:00 to 06:00 AM was linked to a higher risk of heart failure hospitalization.\nThese findings suggest that both long-term HRV measures and hourly HRV responses may serve as indicators of CVD risk. However, a key observation is that long-term HRV was assessed under free-living conditions, which restricts the comparability of results to standardized tests of autonomic function, although it provides insights that are more comparable to what may be found with long-term wearable devices. In the CANCAN Study (Study III), standardized CARTs were used to define CAN and to describe indicators of heart failure, including elevated NT-proBNP, WATCH-DM risk, and NYHA classification, among individuals with and without CAN in a population with T2D. In CANCAN, two out of five had CAN. Compared to individuals without CAN, these individuals more often showed signs of heart failure, including elevated NT-proBNP levels, higher WATCH-DM risk scores, and higher classifications on the NYHA. CAN was associated with elevated NT-proBNP levels and these persisted even among individuals without heart failure symptoms based on NYHA classification, as well as among those categorized as having low to moderate heart failure risk according to the WATCH-DM score.\nIn summary, various aspects of autonomic dysfunction and cardiovascular complications were investigated in populations with NGM, prediabetes, or T2D. The overall findings showed that autonomic function, assessed through heart rate dynamics of long-term HRV and diurnal HRV or heart rate responses to autonomic reflex tests, is associated with a higher risk of CVD and heart failure. This relationship appears to be stronger in more severe stages of dysglycemia. Moreover, among individuals with T2D, the presence of CAN may help identify those at higher risk of heart failure, even in the absence of heart failure symptoms."

    "section": "7.2 Cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction and its impact on heart disease across glucose metabolism",
    "text": "7.2 Cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction and its impact on heart disease across glucose metabolism\nThis dissertation shows that autonomic dysfunction, measured by HRV and CARTs, is associated with CVD risk across the spectrum of glucose metabolism dysregulation. This association is evident in measures of arteriosclerosis, atherosclerotic events, all-cause mortality, and heart failure in individuals at high risk of diabetes, as well as in indicators of heart failure in patients with T2D.\n\n7.2.0.1 Arteriosclerosis\nIn Study I, autonomic dysfunction, measured by 24-hour HRV, was shown to be cross-sectionally associated with arterial stiffness, measured both dynamically (cf PWV) and locally (CD). Adjustments for demographic and lifestyle factors, as well as a range of cardiovascular risk factors, did not explain the association. This suggests that autonomic responses under free-living conditions may contribute to the development of arterial stiffness. The majority of studies in the field have shown an association between autonomic dysfunction, as measured by short-term HRV during rest, and arterial stiffness in populations with either type 1 or T2D.1,2 Study I further extended this perspective by examining long-term HRV in a population without diabetes or prediabetes.\n\n\n\n\nAutonomic dysfunction and arterial stiffness. (Source: Author). —.\n\n\n\nArterial stiffness is not only a structural marker of vascular ageing but is also dynamically modulated by local endothelial signals and autonomic nervous system activity. Several studies have demonstrated a link between elevated sympathetic tone and higher arterial stiffness.3,4 Two possible mechanisms may explain how autonomic dysfunction is related to arterial stiffness.\nFirst, autonomic dysfunction may raise vascular tone in large arteries, reducing elasticity. Animal studies support this, showing that proper autonomic regulation is essential for maintaining aortic elasticity.5 This effect may, in part, be transient and reversible if autonomic function is restored. However, chronic sympathetic overstimulation can lead to structural remodeling and sustained stiffness.[@mangoni1997] While such findings cannot be directly extrapolated to humans, they suggest plausible biological pathways.[@schaarup2023]\nSecond, the autonomic nervous system controls heart rate and cardiac contractility.[@nardone2020] Autonomic dysfunction, characterized by increased sympathetic activity and reduced parasympathetic tone, elevates rHR and arterial shear stress, potentially contributing to structural arterial stiffening. Data from the Whitehall II study found that a steeper 10-year decline in short-term resting HRV was associated with greater aortic stiffness five years later.[@schaarup2023]\nThe association between 24-hour HRV and arterial stiffness (Study II) was modified by dysglycemia, suggesting dysglycemia may induce CAN that can affect arterial stiffness, even before the onset of T2D.6–8 Data from the Whitehall II study showed that aortic stiffness increased more steeply with higher HbA1c values among non-diabetic individuals9, supporting this notion. In the subpopulation in Study I without diabetes, a modification by HbA1c in both aortic and carotid stiffness was observed. The modifying effect of HbA1c suggests that hyperglycaemia amplifies the consequences of autonomic dysfunction.\n\n\n7.2.0.2 Atherosclerosis\nStudy II showed that individuals with a preclinical stage of autonomic dysfunction, measured by multiday HRV, face a higher risk of incident ischemic CVD, heart failure, and all-cause mortality.\nMultiday HRV was assessed to capture autonomic activity in real-life settings across several days. Our results are consistent with earlier research linking lower HRV (including measures from 10 seconds to 24 hours) to CVD and mortality.10,11 Findings from Study II build on existing evidence by: (1) focusing on a population at elevated risk for diabetes, (2) employing multiday HRV recordings, and (3) identifying specific times of day when HRV patterns were indicative of ischemic-related cardiovascular risk. By using both week-long and hourly data, we identified specific periods that provide a better indication of long-term risk. A strength of using multiday HRV recordings is that they provide more robust insights into individual autonomic patterns by averaging autonomic responses across typical daily conditions. This reduces the influence of random fluctuations caused by factors such as physical activity, emotional states, or sleep on any single day.12\nMultiple mechanisms may explain how autonomic dysfunction contributes to the initiation and progression of ischemic events and stroke. First, as discussed in Study I, autonomic dysfunction may contribute to arterial stiffness, a dynamic and potentially modifiable process that impairs vasodilation and increases hemodynamic stress, thereby elevating the risk of ischemic events.[@bentzon2014; @zieman2005;@gottsäter2006]\nSecond, the autonomic nervous system innervates the adventitia layer of blood vessels, modulating vascular tone via sympathetic fibres.[@ziegler2025] Although plaques form in the intima, higher plaque burden has been linked to increased local sympathetic nerve density, possibly through neuroinflammatory pathways.[@mohanta2022] Autonomic dysfunction likely exerts systemic effects on the vasculature[@ziegler2025], making a direct role in plaque formation uncertain, but it may compromise vasodilatory capacity during ischemic or thrombotic events. Notably, reduced sympathetic innervation has attenuated plaque formation in animal models, supporting indirect effects on atherogenesis.[@mohanta2022]\nThird, autonomic dysfunction has been shown to interfere with signalling pathways controlling heart rhythm, potentially leading to arrhythmias. Earlier studies have shown lower short-term HRV was associated with incident atrial fibrillation (AF), with a higher risk among participants with T2D.10,13 This supports the role of autonomic dysfunction in arrhythmogenesis, which increases the risk of myocardial infarction and stroke.14 Study II did not include atrial fibrillation (AF) as an outcome due to limitations in Danish registries prior to 2016, which often failed to distinguish between short- and long-term AF, thereby compromising diagnostic validity15.\nOur study focused on long-term HRV under free-living conditions, capturing stress-responsive periods such as morning awakening. These recordings likely reflect underlying autonomic dynamics relevant to cardiovascular risk. A Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) in the UK Biobank of short-term HRV supports this by identifying mechanisms involving G-protein signaling, pacemaker activity, and mitochondrial function as likely mediators of the genetic contribution to HRV. These pathways influence vagal control, cardiac excitability, and energy metabolism.16 Although derived from short-term recordings, these genetic associations may reflect autonomic traits that persist across different time scales and reinforce the notion of a biological basis for inter-individual differences in HRV, preceding and independent of the onset of dysglycaemia. A Mendelian randomization study using data from the Rotterdam Study found that genetically predicted HRV was associated with a higher risk of AF.17 However, this association did not extend to all-cause mortality or cardiovascular death in the UK Biobank cohort, where only phenotypically measured HRV showed a significant relationship with these outcomes.18 Interestingly, the genetic determinants of HRV exhibited pleiotropic relationships with several autonomic traits, including resting heart rate, heart rate response during exercise, and post-exercise recovery dynamics.18 No GWAS has yet been conducted for long-term HRV. Therefore, it is unclear whether the genetic influences identified for short-term HRV are applicable to long-term HRV. Future GWAS efforts targeting long-term HRV could help establish causal relationships to CVD by leveraging methods such as Mendelian randomization and advancing our understanding of the genetic architecture underlying autonomic regulation under a full day.\n\n\n7.2.0.3 Heart failure\nThe relationship between cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction and heart failure is complex.19 On one hand, autonomic dysfunction contributes to cardiac remodelling and eventual heart failure. On the other hand, it may reflect compensatory mechanisms of the progression of cardiac remodelling and declining cardiac output. Our findings demonstrated a relationship between autonomic dysfunction and heart failure both cross-sectionally in a population with T2D and prospectively in individuals representing different tiers of diabetes risk. However, our data are limited in determining the extent to which this relationship supports one explanation over the other, as we lack baseline and follow-up measures of both heart failure and HRV.\nPrevious studies have shown that both short- and long-term HRV are associated with incident heart failure in populations with and without T2D.20–23 Findings from Study  II extended prior work by applying multiday HRV recordings to a population at high risk for diabetes and by: (1) assessing the role of resting heart rate in the HRV–heart failure relationship, and (2) identifying time-of-day heart rate patterns associated with heart failure risk.\nSeveral mechanisms may underlie this relationship. In Study I, a link between autonomic dysfunction and arterial stiffness was confirmed. Arterial stiffness is known to contribute to cardiac remodelling by increasing cardiac afterload and reducing coronary perfusion through earlier return of the reflected pulse wave.[@boutouyrie2021] This suggests that autonomic dysfunction may indirectly influence heart failure through arterial stiffness. However, structured methods such as mediation analysis with repeated measures are needed to clarify these pathways.\nStudy II showed that multiday HRV was associated with incident heart failure, and approximately one-fourth of the risk was explained by resting heart rate. Data from the Rotterdam Study showed that resting short-term HRV was longitudinally associated with echocardiographic measures reflecting systolic function, suggesting that autonomic dysfunction contributes to cardiac remodelling.24 In contrast to MACE outcomes, findings from Study II showed no specific time point in hourly HRV that was associated with heart failure. Instead, it was the overall daily pattern captured by multiday HRV that was linked to heart failure risk. This suggests that the association is not driven by isolated shifts in autonomic activity in response to circadian stressors, but rather by a consistently impaired autonomic balance under free-living conditions.\nIn Study III, individuals with CAN were found to have higher risk of elevated NT-proBNP, a biomarker of myocardial stress and early heart failure. This supports the interpretation that CAN contributes to both structural and functional cardiac changes, reflected in elevated NT-proBNP levels.\nReverse causation cannot be ruled out, as autonomic dysfunction may also reflect compensatory responses to progressing heart failure. Furthermore, the extent to which parasympathetic activity can buffer sympathetic dominance remains unclear, as does whether declining HRV reflects a breakdown of this balance. CAN and cardiac remodelling may interact in a reinforcing cycle: autonomic dysfunction increases sympathetic tone and reduces parasympathetic modulation, promoting cardiac stress and remodelling, which in turn further impairs autonomic regulation.25 This feedback loop may accelerate heart failure progression, although this remains beyond the scope of the current data and analysis."

    "section": "7.3 Clinical implications",
    "text": "7.3 Clinical implications\nThe dissertation investigates autonomic dysfunction in populations ranging from NGM to T2D and yields insights relevant for individuals who engage with the healthcare system at different levels. No specific role has yet been defined for autonomic dysfunction in clinical decision-making within healthcare, as current treatment and intervention options specifically targeting autonomic function remain limited. Although the results do not point directly to where and how implementation of autonomic dysfunction in clinical practice may make sense, the included studies broadly represent situations relevant to public health, primary care, and secondary care settings. In the following section, the clinical implications of using autonomic dysfunction in the prevention of CVD will be discussed. If long-term HRV or CARTs are to be considered for improving risk stratification, it is important to determine at what stage in the progression of diabetes risk, and at which level of care, autonomic dysfunction becomes meaningful for early detection and intervention.\n\n7.3.1 Public health\nA central strategy in preventing CVD is the early identification and multifactorial treatment of individuals at high risk.26 Public health initiatives support this by promoting healthy lifestyles, facilitating early screening for risk factors, and improving access to essential care and medications. Long-term HRV may enhance these efforts by identifying individuals with elevated cardiovascular risk and by tracking their physiological response to lifestyle changes.\nEvidence from Study I showed that lower long-term HRV was associated with higher arterial stiffness, as measured by cf-PWV and CD, even in individuals without T2D. One standard deviation lower HRV corresponded to the effect of 2.7 additional years of ageing on aortic stiffness (cf-PWV) and 1.6 years on carotid stiffness (CD).27 These cross-sectional findings suggest that HRV may serve as a marker of early vascular ageing and cardiovascular risk. Supporting this, the Whitehall II study demonstrated a longitudinal relationship between short-term HRV and aortic stiffness. Together, these findings highlight the potential of HRV as an indicator of vascular health. Within the public health setting, individuals with prediabetes represent a particularly vulnerable group at risk for comorbidities.28 They often fall between structured care pathways, sometimes encouraged to reassess their cardiovascular risk at more frequent intervals, other times not offered any additional measures or attention beyond general lifestyle advice. Notably, Studies I and II demonstrated that the associations between long-term HRV and CVD risk were especially pronounced in this population. In those at high risk of diabetes, a one standard deviation (33 ms) lower multiday SDNN was equivalent to 4.5 additional years of ageing for ischemic-related CVD and 2.2 to 2.4 years for heart failure.29 On a population level, lower HRV (SDNN: 100 ms) in individuals with prediabetes was associated with a higher incidence rate of CVD, heart failure, and all-cause mortality compared to individuals with normal-to-higher HRV (SDNN: 120 to 160 ms). These findings reinforce the role of HRV as an early and sensitive marker of cardiovascular health in populations at cardiometabolic risk.\nWhile these findings highlight HRV’s potential, practical implementation faces several challenges. Historically, long-term HRV monitoring has required specialized equipment such as Holter ECG recorders. However, the growing popularity of wearable devices offers a promising alternative. These devices provide a non-invasive, user-friendly way to collect heart rate and HRV data over time, under free-living conditions like those examined in Study II.30\nIf HRV monitoring proves effective in helping individuals maintain a healthy, age-adjusted HRV range through lifestyle changes and prompts healthcare engagement when HRV deteriorates, it could become a meaningful tool for long-term health tracking. A cross-sectional study of 8 million individuals found that those who took more steps per day had higher HRV, suggesting that HRV may also reflect a healthy lifestyle, which has been longitudinally confirmed in the Whitehall II study.31,32 In addition to the ADDITION-PRO study, the inclusion of data from future observational cohorts that incorporate wearable devices, along with precise lifestyle measures such as physical activity, diet, and sleep, could enhance the understanding of patterns influencing long-term heart rate variability and diurnal autonomic responses.33,34\nA major public health challenge lies in ensuring equitable access to wearable technology. Individuals from lower socioeconomic backgrounds are less likely to own such devices, raising concerns about health disparities. Despite this, there is encouraging evidence that the general population is receptive to digital health innovations. Many are willing to share health data with public institutions and support the use of AI in disease monitoring.30,35\nIntegrating wearable HRV monitoring into public health strategies could represent a transformative step in proactive cardiovascular care. It may support early detection, personalized prevention, and timely referral to primary care when risk levels increase.\n\n\n7.3.2 Primary care\nCardiovascular risk in primary care is assessed using clinical evaluations and standardized risk prediction tools to identify individuals at elevated risk. Management focuses on lifestyle modification, pharmacological therapy, and regular monitoring to reduce cardiovascular events36. In this context, long-term HRV may offer added value by improving the precision of cardiovascular risk stratification and by serving as a marker to monitor the effectiveness of preventive strategies.\nLong-term HRV may improve ranking of individual risk when added to established clinical risk scores. Tools such as SCORE2 and the Framingham Risk Score are widely used in primary care to guide cardiovascular risk assessment.37,38 In Study I, models adjusted for conventional CVD risk factors supported the potential added value of 24-hour HRV in relation to arterial stiffness, a surrogate marker of CVD risk. Study II extended this perspective by demonstrating associations between multiday HRV and incident CVD and heart failure. However, these findings are based on associations and do not include formal prediction modeling39, and therefore cannot determine whether incorporating long-term HRV or CARTs into existing risk scores improves predictive performance beyond current guidelines. This study design is not feasible in ADDITION-PRO, as the cohort does not represent high-risk diabetes populations typically identified in primary care (e.g., elevated HbA1c). Likewise, CANCAN is limited by its small sample size and recruitment from secondary care. To assess predictive value, cohorts should reflect individuals with T2D or those at high risk, as defined by current clinical practice.\nMost biomarkers have shown limited incremental value beyond established predictors (including age, sex, lipid profiles, diabetes status, and blood pressure). Few studies suggest that 24-hour HRV may improve risk discrimination for CVD and all-cause mortality in individuals with T2D40, and for stroke and heart failure in older adults.20,41 However, these studies often lack calibration or validation in large-scale cohorts and have not been integrated with widely used risk scores such as SCORE2 or the Framingham Risk Score.\nLong-term HRV may also help classify preclinical autonomic dysfunction, enabling targeted interventions in a subgroup of patients to prevent CVD. The increasing availability of wearable devices capable of capturing long-term HRV data presents a practical opportunity for continuous monitoring in primary care. These devices may facilitate earlier detection of autonomic dysfunction and support more personalized approaches to cardiovascular risk management. However, the clinical utility of stratifying patients based on preclinical autonomic dysfunction remains uncertain. These considerations are only actionable if interventions in this subgroup can be shown to lower cardiovascular risk. Emerging evidence suggests that both pharmacological and lifestyle interventions can improve HRV in the short term.42,43 For example, high-intensity interval training has been shown to improve autonomic function in obese individuals with and without T2D.44 Similarly, lifestyle changes in individuals with prediabetes have been associated with improvements in short-term HRV, which may partly explain a reduction in diabetes risk independently of weight loss.45 Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether these effects on HRV are sustainable over time and whether they translate into long-term cardiovascular protection. In many cases, improvements in autonomic function may be mediated indirectly through changes in cardiometabolic markers such as glucose levels, lipid profiles, body weight, maximal oxygen uptake, and blood pressure.\nDespite these uncertainties, monitoring autonomic function through long-term HRV may offer a valuable tool for assessing cardiovascular risk and tracking the impact of preventive strategies. In Denmark, prediabetes, defined by HbA1c, is present in 7.1% of adults.46 One in five of these individuals develops T2D within five years46, while others either remain in the prediabetic stage or return to normoglycemia. Despite their higher risk of CVD and heart failure47, individuals with prediabetes are not captured by existing preventive strategies. This underscores the need for early and precise risk assessment.48 Given that the cardiovascular consequences of autonomic dysfunction appear to be more pronounced in individuals with prediabetes compared to those with normoglycemia, HRV has the potential to help identify those at elevated CVD risk within this group. However, evidence demonstrating improved risk prediction and sustained effects leading to better cardiovascular outcomes is needed to establish its relevance for integration into primary care.\n\n\n7.3.3 Secondary care\nIn secondary care, endocrinologists assess cardiovascular and heart failure risk by integrating advanced diagnostics, biomarker analysis, and imaging to detect early heart failure, guided by symptoms and risk profiles. The treatment of patients with T2D is guided by evidence-based therapies and multidisciplinary collaboration.49–51 The ADA/EASD 2022 consensus on Management of Hyperglycemia in T2D emphasizes that early detection of heart failure in individuals with T2D is crucial, as it enables timely initiation of therapies such as SGLT2i, which have demonstrated significant benefits in lowering heart failure-related outcomes.51 A major challenge in diabetes care is detecting heart failure before symptoms appear, as patients with symptomatic heart failure face a higher risk of mortality and more frequent hospitalizations.50 The AHA, ACC, and HFSA 2022 guidelines recommend identifying individuals at risk of heart failure based on factors such as diabetes, poor glycaemic control, uncontrolled hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, elevated BMI, albuminuria, renal dysfunction, and a history of CVD.49 Still, there is a need to identify optimal approaches for recognizing and diagnosing heart failure in clinical care, as broad echocardiographic screening in T2D is time-consuming and costly.50\nStudy III demonstrated that CAN may help identify individuals at higher risk of heart failure, beyond what is captured by symptoms or existing risk scores. Our findings support considering CAN as a relevant risk factor for heart failure and suggest it may have value in future risk stratification strategies in T2D. A clinical advantage of using CARTs is that they are standardized tests performed under controlled conditions. CARTs have proven to be reliable and reproducible, with reference values established in large population studies.52 Beyond these findings and the established evidence of higher heart failure risk, CAN also identifies individuals at high risk for overall CVD, kidney disease, and early mortality in the T2D population.53,54 In Study III, I observed that two out of five participants had CAN, highlighting it as a complication with considerable prevalence. Therefore, detecting CAN may uncover an often-overlooked condition that is common in individuals with T2D.\nClinical stratification of care includes two key considerations: (1) CAN should be further evaluated for associated cardiovascular complications, such as heart failure; and (2) cardiopreventive strategies should be initiated earlier in this subgroup.\nFirst, patients with CAN may benefit from further cardiovascular assessment, including the use of sensitive biomarkers or echocardiography. NT-proBNP is a strong predictor of heart failure and a validated biomarker for ruling out the condition.49 However, its specificity varies across heart failure phenotypes, being less specific for detecting HFpEF compared to HFrEF.49 Therefore, additional evaluation using echocardiography may be warranted. Beyond classifying heart failure phenotypes, echocardiography identifies preclinical stages of heart failure through the detection of functional or structural cardiac abnormalities. Including CAN in structured assessments of heart failure could help clarify to which extent CAN overlaps with cardiac abnormalities. Determining the diagnostic and prognostic value of CAN, particularly its sensitivity and specificity in detecting HFrEF and HFpEF, requires further investigation.\nSecond, the presence of CAN may justify earlier initiation of protective therapies. SGLT2i are recommended as second-line treatment in T2D and have demonstrated benefits in lowering the risk of heart failure, CVD, and kidney function decline, complications commonly associated with CAN. Current guidelines recommend initiating these therapies based on a history of CVD, heart failure, or the presence of conventional high-risk cardiovascular factors. However, the specific impact of SGLT2i on the progression of cardiorenal outcomes in patients with CAN remains to be fully understood. Furthermore, while antihypertensive treatment is a cornerstone of cardiovascular risk management, whether specific classes of antihypertensive agents offer protective effects in patients with CAN remains to be explored.\nThe direct clinical implications of our findings in Study III are limited. The generalizability of our results is restricted, as our study population consisted of patients with T2D receiving secondary care. Two out of five patients with CAN showed to have a history of CVD, a group already at higher risk of heart failure due to their prior diagnosis. This overlap may influence the interpretation of CAN as an independent risk factor. Therefore, these findings need to be validated in a broader population with T2D, including individuals without a history of CVD. Doing so would allow for greater generalizability of our results to the broader T2D population, particularly those visiting primary care."

    "text": "7.4 Strengths and limitations\n\n7.4.1 Study design\nCross-sectional design\nStudies I and III are based on cross-sectional data, with exposure and outcome measured within a three-month period. The main limitation of this design is that it does not allow us to determine whether the exposure led to the outcome or vice versa. As a result, we cannot establish temporality or confirm whether changes in the outcome were caused by the exposure. Based on prior evidence, the direction of the associations in Study I was inferred using physiological knowledge and findings from epidemiological and in vivo studies.55\nStudy III focused on the clinical diagnosis of CAN and the presence of heart failure. The research question was oriented toward the clinical utility of CAN in identifying patients with T2D who may be progressing early toward heart failure. Whether cardiac function progressively worsens due to the underlying mechanisms of CAN remains to be fully established.56\nLongitudinal design\nA major strength of Study II is its longitudinal design, where HRV was measured at baseline and outcomes were captured prospectively through national registries. This temporal structure ensures that the exposure (HRV) preceded the outcome, lowering the risk of reverse causation. The prospective design allows for stronger inference of directionality than cross-sectional studies. Furthermore, the use of high-quality registry data ensures complete outcome ascertainment and minimizes loss to follow-up bias.\nCausality cannot be ascertained from the findings in Study I and Study II, and more causally focused methods are needed. Mendelian randomization, which uses genetic instruments for exposure, could help address this question. Additionally, structured mediation analysis involving modifications such as medication or lifestyle changes could clarify whether improving HRV or CART reduces cardiovascular risk, using data from intervention studies.\n\n\n7.4.2 Internal validity\nCardiovascular autonomic function was assessed in this project both under free-living conditions and in response to standardized test procedures conducted during clinical visits. Additionally, dynamic measurements were used to evaluate arterial stiffness both locally and by velocity, and biomarker assessments were performed to determine the presence of heart failure. In this section, the validity of 24-hour, multiday, and hourly HRV measurements is discussed, along with the standardized tests of CAN. The validity of the included outcomes is also addressed, and the strengths and limitations of using MACE as a time-to-event outcome are examined.\n\n7.4.2.1 Long-term HRV (&gt;24 hours) as measurement for autonomic function\nA main consideration in HRV analysis is the reliability of raw inter-beat interval data from ECG recordings. To ensure accurate HRV measures, the intervals must be captured in a continuous and correctly sequenced manner. Frequency-domain analyses depend on the inter-beat interval sequence, aw well as time-domain measures, such as RMSSD and pNN50, specifically quantify the variability in the differences between successive intervals.\nIn Study I, data from a 12-lead Holter system was used, which is considered the gold standard for long-term ECG recordings. With detailed and sequential inter-beat intervals, all HRV metrics were calculated.\nIn Study II, data from the Actiheart device was used for HRV. The device was configured to record continuously over an 8-day period. It captured 30-second epochs of mean heart rate intervals, along with upper and lower prediction intervals. From each epoch, I generated a distribution of inter-beat intervals. An algorithm was applied to estimate HRV from these distributions, and its validation showed strong agreement with established metrics, including SDNN, SDANN, and the SDNN index.57,58 However, a limitation of this dataset is that it did not allow for the calculation of frequency-domain measures or specific time-domain metrics such as RMSSD or pNN50.58\nAutonomic nervous function, as measured by long-term HRV in free-living conditions, may also be influenced by behavioral factors such as physical activity, sleep, meal timing, emotions, smoking, caffeine intake, alcohol consumption, and medication use. These factors can potentially mask or mimic underlying physiological dysfunction during recordings, but they may also elicit the HRV responses of interest.12 HRV is also shaped by lifestyle patterns over time, making it sensitive not only to day-to-day behaviors but also to long-term habits that affect autonomic balance.59\nIn Studies I and II, habitual physical activity was accounted for, and in Study II, hourly HRV was adjusted for physical movement during recordings to test the influence of concurrent activity. However, further studies are needed to understand how lifestyle patterns affect long-term HRV recordings, in order to separate direct behavioral from physiological components. In both studies, participants with prior CVD were excluded to preserve the etiological order between autonomic dysfunction and cardiovascular outcomes.\nAnti-hypertensive medications, especially beta-blockers, are known to increase HRV in randomized controlled trials.60 However, in cohort studies, participants using anti-hypertensives generally show lower HRV, likely reflecting a higher burden of cardiovascular complications [ref]. Because beta-blockers target the autonomic nervous system, they may introduce bias in HRV measurements by interfering with the function. In sensitivity analyses in Studies I and III, excluding participants on anti-hypertensive treatment did not materially change the estimates. Therefore, these participants where kept and adjusted for medication use in the full models.\nBeyond the behavioral and pharmacological contribution to HRV, we cannot physiologically distinguish whether autonomic dysfunction is primarily driven by higher sympathetic activity or lower parasympathetic tone. Much of the current evidence on autonomic contributions to HRV originates from studies involving experimental manipulation of the autonomic nervous system, such as physiological tests (e.g., tilt response, deep breathing, stress response) or pharmacological modulation. Therefore, it remains uncertain whether the mechanisms linking HRV indices to cardiovascular complications are predominantly due to sympathetic overactivity or parasympathetic withdrawal.\nHRV levels are influenced by heart rate, as lower resting heart rate allows for greater variability. In Study I, I chose not to adjust for heart rate in our models, as this could introduce multicollinearity. Additionally, elevated heart rate is driven by higher sympathetic activity and may act as a mediator in the pathway leading to arterial stiffness. Our use of full-day recordings captures HRV during both rest and activity, providing a robust representation of autonomic function over a typical day. In contrast, heart rate correction may be more relevant for short-term HRV recordings, where standardized conditions can be affected by random influences such as time of day, smoking, or caffeine intake.52 These factors would have been relevant in Study III had I included HRV measures. In Study II, I used the residuals method to pre-adjust HRV measures for resting heart rate, which accounted for part of the observed associations, particularly with heart failure and all-cause mortality, and to a lesser extent with ischemic-related CVD events. Similar trends were observed for hourly associations, where heart rate pre-adjustment had comparable effects on the outcomes.\nThe three studies demonstrate approaches to identifying CVD risk: (1) selecting appropriate HRV indices, (2) segmenting time intervals, and (3) assessing HRV under defined conditions. Our findings indicate that associations between long-term HRV indices and arterial stiffness vary, with RMSSD and HF showing weaker associations. Similar patterns have been observed in long-term HRV measures among individuals with type 2 diabetes.2 However, previous research has shown that these indices can be informative when analyzed in 5-minute segments.[@hadad2021; @chellappa2025;55] Additionally, SDNN exhibited varying associations with CVD risk depending on the time of day. We also observed that, in CARTs, the Valsalva maneuver and deep breathing test were more indicative of heart failure. These insights highlight the relevance of methodological decisions in HRV research, particularly in aligning index selection, time segmentation, and response conditions with specific research objectives and clinical contexts.\n\n\n7.4.2.2 Cardiovascular autonomic reflex test\nCART provides a practical approach for screening for autonomic dysfunction and has been shown to be a reliable method.61 Although certain indices from CARTs may be influenced by factors such as time of day or recent physical activity, these effects are generally minimal. Furthermore, no impact of caffeine intake has been observed on the reference age-based formula.52 A limitation of the CARTs in this study was the high prevalence of participants who were unable to complete the full battery of tests, primarily due to missing data from the Valsalva maneuver.\n\n\n7.4.2.3 Measures of cardiovascular risk\nIn Study I, arterial stiffness measures, including cf-PWV and CD, are influenced by MAP, which may confound the assessment of vascular stiffness. In Study I, we adjusted for MAP, which attenuated the observed associations. However, the associations remained statistically significant.\nIn Study II, outcomes were based on CVD events, heart failure, and causes of death from Danish national registries. Potential misclassification and underreporting, especially of heart failure, may have led to underestimation of associations.62\nIn Study III, NT-proBNP was used as a primary indicator of heart failure. While NT-proBNP is a validated biomarker for early-stage heart failure and useful for ruling out the condition, its specificity varies by HF phenotype.49 Thus, we cannot determine HFpEF or HFrEF. Its diagnostic accuracy is influenced by factors such as AF, obesity, and kidney function.49 Individuals with AF were excluded by design. Analysis was adjusted for BMI, which did not affect the association between CAN and elevated NT-proBNP. After adjusting for eGFR, the association became stronger, suggesting that lower kidney function may have masked the true link between CAN and heart failure risk.\n\n\n\n7.4.3 External validity\n\n7.4.3.1 Selection bias\nThe Maastricht Study\nThe target population in Study I was intended to represent individuals at different stages of glucose metabolism. However, the analysis may have been affected by selection bias in the representation of individuals with T2D. Participants in the Maastricht Study were recruited based on their ability and willingness to attend multiple research visits and receive personal health feedback, which likely attracted health-conscious individuals with higher education levels. As a result, individuals with T2D were relatively healthy, with a median disease duration of three years and a low prevalence of complications. Those who completed both long-term ECG and arterial stiffness assessments may have represented an even healthier subgroup. This selection bias may have limited the generalizability of the findings to the broader T2D population and may explain why the effect modification did not differ step-wise from that observed in individuals with prediabetes.\nADDITION-PRO\nThe target population in Study II was intended to represent individuals at high risk of developing T2D. Participants were recruited through a stepwise screening procedure. Initially, individuals were selected based on a risk score derived from a self-administered questionnaire sent by mail. Those with high scores were invited for further testing using HbA1c or random glucose measurements.\nThis recruitment strategy involved selection by design, as the source population was defined based on specific risk criteria. The questionnaire prioritized risk factors such as older age and hypertension, leading to overrepresentation of these groups.63 Prediabetes was identified only after biochemical testing, while the risk score was primarily designed to detect undiagnosed T2D. Although this selection process was intentional and aligned with the ADDITION-PRO objectives, the generalizability of the findings to the broader population at risk for T2D may have been limited.\nIn addition, selection bias may have occurred due to differential participation in the ADDITION screening program. Healthier individuals were more likely to participate, both by completing the risk questionnaire and by attending follow-up testing.64 As a result, the baseline risk for CVD in ADDITION-PRO participants may have been lower compared to the target population.\nCANCAN\nThe target population in Study III was intended to represent individuals with T2D treated in outpatient clinics. In Denmark, patients with T2D are referred to diabetes specialists at outpatient clinics when their general practitioner is unable to stabilize their condition. A strength of the CANCAN sampling strategy was that patients were already attending endocrinology consultations, and the study examination required only additional time during their visit, without the need for extra transportation or appointments. Assessing selection bias in this study is challenging, as inclusion depended on referral practices by general practitioners.65 These practices may have varied individually, with differing thresholds for referring patients to specialized care based on clinical judgment and patient characteristics.\n\n\n7.4.3.2 Generalisability\nThe generalisability of the findings has been considered in the context of the targeted recruitment strategies used in each study, which were aimed at including individuals across a spectrum of diabetes risk, from NGM to established T2D. As a result, the findings are most applicable to populations with similar clinical profiles and healthcare settings.\nStudies I–III included individuals at high risk of diabetes and those with T2D. Therefore, the associations between cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction and cardiovascular outcomes or surrogate biomarkers are relevant to individuals with some degree of diabetes risk and progressed T2D. Study I suggested that the link between autonomic dysfunction and cardiovascular risk, as measured by arterial stiffness, was also present in individuals with NGM, though to a lesser extent. This finding, supported by replication in the Whitehall II cohort, indicated that the observed relationship may extend beyond high-risk groups and into the general population.55 In Study III, participants represented a higher-risk diabetes group among Danish diabetes patients, while more stable patients remained under general practitioner care. Consequently, the prevalence of heart failure indicators and CAN was likely higher in this selected group than in patients managed in primary care, and thus the extension of the findings to broader T2D populations is limited.\nBy design, younger individuals with prediabetes or young-adult-onset T2D were underrepresented in the studies. This group may have been overlooked in current research and warrants further attention in future studies.46,66 The applicability of the findings to other countries may be influenced by differences in demographic composition, risk factor distributions, healthcare systems, and stages of economic development. These factors can affect both the prevalence of diabetes and cardiovascular disease and the nature of their associations. While the study populations were primarily of Nordic and Western European descent, differences in ethnic composition are only one of several factors that may influence external validity. These regions also share relatively well-organized, publicly funded healthcare systems, which may differ substantially from those in other parts of the world and further affect the applicability of the findings.\n\n\n\n\n1 Angela Beros, John Sluyter, Robert Keith Rhodes Scragg.
