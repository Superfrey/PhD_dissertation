Among the time-domain indices, SDNN, SDNNi, and SDANN showed the strongest associations, with cf-PWV being lower by 2.5% (CI: 2.0; 3.1), 2.5% (CI: 1.9; 3.4), and 2.2% (CI: 1.7; 2.7), respectively. Conversely, CD was higher by 3.2% (CI: 1.7; 4.7), 3.0 % (CI: 1.4; 4.6), and 2.8% (CI: 1.3; 4.3), respectively. RMSSD and pNN50 showed a weaker association with cf-PWV (-1.1% [CI: -1.4; -0.4], and -1.1 [-1.7; -0.6]), while no evidence for an association was found with CD.\nFrequency-domain HRV\nIn the fully adjusted model 2, cf-PWV was 2.8% (CI: 2.1; 3.5) lower, while CD was 3.2% (CI: 1.3; 5.1) higher per SD higher in HRV frequency-domain Z-score. Among the frequency-domain indices, total power, VLF, and ULF showed the strongest associations, with cf-PWV being lower by 2.2% (CI: 1.7; 2.8 ), 2.4% (CI: 1.9; 4.0), and 2.1% (CI: 1.5; 2.6), respectively. Conversely, CD was higher by 2.7% (CI: 1.2; 4.2), 2.4% (CI: 0.9; 4.1), and 2.6% (CI: 1.1; 4.1), respectively. HF showed a weaker association with cf-PWV (-0.9% [CI: -1.4; -0.4]), while no evidence for an association was found with CD. Mean interbeat interval was associated with 2.4 % (CI: 1.8; 2.9) lower cf-PWV and 4.5% (3.1; 6.1) higher CD.\n\n\n5.1.3 Effect modification of diabetes status\nThe study population represented diabetes risk of normal glucose metabolism (65%), prediabetes (15%), and type 2 diabetes (20%). The median (IQR) cf-PWV (aortic stiffness) became higher with diabetes status: NGM: 8.08 m/s (7.28, 9.16), prediabetes: 8.96 m/s (7.84, 10.32), and type 2 diabetes: 9.36 m/s (8.16, 10.80). CD (carotid stiffness) decreased: NGM: 15.0 (11.8, 18.8), prediabetes: 13.5 (10.4, 16.9), and type 2 diabetes: 12.5 (9.9, 16.0) × 10⁻³/kPa. SDNN (ms) was highest in NGM and decreased with worsening glucose metabolism: NGM: 138ms (117, 164), prediabetes: 127ms (106, 152), and type 2 diabetes: 116ms (96, 139). Further description of charaterisitcs by diabetes are described in Table 5.1.\nThe association between HRV time-domain Z-scores and cf-PWV and CD was significantly modified by prediabetes (cf-PWV: -4.9 [CI: -6.523; -3.243] \\(^{interaction(*) ^{p-value&lt; 0.01}}\\) CD: 8.0 [CI:3.8; 12.5]\\(^{*^{p-value&lt; 0.01}}\\)) but not by type 2 diabetes (cf-PWV: -3.5 % [CI: -4.8; -2.1)] \\(^{*^{p-value&lt; 0.1}}\\) CD: 4.8 % [CI:1.3; 8.4]\\(^{*^{p-value&lt; 0.1}}\\)). For the indices SDNN and SDANN, the association with both cf-PWV and CD was significantly modified by both prediabetes and type 2 diabetes.\nThe association between HRV frequency-domain Z-score and cf-PWV was significantly modified from normal glucose metabolism by prediabetes (-5.7 %[CI:-7.4; -3.9]\\(^{*^{p-value&lt; 0.01}}\\)) and type 2 diabetes (-3.9 %[CI:-5.4; -2.3]\\(^{*^{p-value&lt; 0.05}}\\)) while CD was only modified by prediabetes (8.3 %[CI:3.6; 13.2]\\(^{*^{p-value&lt; 0.01}}\\)) but not by type 2 diabetes (5.3 %[CI:1.4; 9.4]\\(^{*^{p-value&lt; 0.1}}\\)). For the indices total power and ULF, the association with both cf-PWV and CD was significantly modified by both prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. Mean inter beat interval association with cf-PWV or CD was not significantly modified by diabetes status.\nAs I did not observe a stepwise increase in the modification of glucose metabolism status from prediabetes to type 2 diabetes, I excluded the subgroup with type 2 diabetes to test whether the association was gradually modified by dysglycemia. In this subgroup, the association between HRV time and frequency domain Z-scores and measures of arterial stiffness was modified by HbA1c (range of interaction p-values: 0.1 to 0.005) (see Figure Figure 5.1). For example, per SD lower HRV frequency domain Z-score at HbA1c 6.4% was associated with a 5.4% higher (CI: 3.5; 7.2) cf-PWV, which was 2.0% to 4.0% higher compared to the magnitude of association at HbA1c levels of 5.6% and 4.8% (see see Figure 5.1 B). In CD, per SD lower HRV frequency domain Z-score at HbA1c 6.4% was associated with an 8.1% lower (CI: -13.5; -2.9) CD, which was 4.8% to 9.5% lower compared to the magnitude of association at HbA1c levels of 5.6% and 4.8% (see Figure 5.1 D). No association between HRV frequency domain Z-score and CD was observed at HbA1c levels between 4.8% and 5.2%.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.1: ?(caption)"

    "text": "5.2 Study II\n\n5.2.1 Descriptive\nThe ADDITION-PRO population consisted of 1,627 participant with a least 48-hour HRV measures, while 1,432 had all hour represented with hourly HRV and physical acceleration. The study population included different tiers of diabetes risk: 154 individuals at low risk (9%), 889 at high risk (51%), 314 with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) (18%), 226 with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) (13%), and 161 with both IFG and IGT (9%). I splitted SDNN into categories by very-low (SDNN&lt; 100 ms), low (SDNN 100-120 ms), middle (SDNN 121-140 ms), high (SDNN 141-160 ms) and very-high (SDNN &gt;160 ms).\nCharteristics are desribed in Table 5.2. Participants in the lowest SDNN group (&lt;100 ms) were older (67.4 ± 6.9 years), had higher BMI (28.1 ± 5.4), HbA1c (5.9 ± 0.9), triglycerides (1.5 ± 0.9 mmol/L), and resting heart rate (67.8 ± 5.7 bpm), were more likely to use anti-hypertensive medication (61%), and had lower physical activity energy expenditure (46.8 ± 24.0 kJ/day) compared to those with higher SDNN levels.\n\n\n\n\nTable 5.2: Study participants charteristics\n\n\nCharacteristic\nOverall, N = 1,625\n&lt;100, N = 148\n100-120, N = 312\n120-140, N = 457\n140-160, N = 346\n&gt;160, N = 362\n\n\n\n\nsex\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMen\n866 (53%)\n68 (46%)\n148 (47%)\n206 (45%)\n203 (59%)\n241 (67%)\n\n\nWomen\n759 (47%)\n80 (54%)\n164 (53%)\n251 (55%)\n143 (41%)\n121 (33%)\n\n\nAge (years)\n65.9 (6.8)\n67.4 (6.9)\n65.7 (6.9)\n66.0 (6.7)\n65.5 (6.6)\n66.0 (7.0)\n\n\nPhysical activity energy expenditure (KJ / day)\n53.1 (25.1)\n46.8 (24.0)\n49.4 (21.0)\n50.7 (21.5)\n57.6 (27.2)\n57.5 (29.2)\n\n\nAlcohol consumption (units per week)\n9.2 (9.5)\n11.3 (10.8)\n10.2 (11.3)\n8.9 (8.5)\n8.5 (9.2)\n8.7 (8.2)\n\n\nSmoking status\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n263 (16%)\n40 (28%)\n70 (23%)\n65 (14%)\n41 (12%)\n47 (13%)\n\n\n2\n750 (47%)\n58 (40%)\n145 (47%)\n214 (47%)\n162 (47%)\n171 (48%)\n\n\n3\n598 (37%)\n47 (32%)\n95 (31%)\n174 (38%)\n140 (41%)\n142 (39%)\n\n\nBMI (kg/m²\n27.7 (4.7)\n28.1 (5.4)\n28.2 (4.6)\n28.0 (4.7)\n27.7 (4.9)\n26.9 (4.2)\n\n\nWaist circumference (cm)\n96.7 (13.4)\n98.0 (14.9)\n98.2 (13.2)\n96.7 (13.6)\n96.7 (13.1)\n94.8 (12.5)\n\n\nSystolic blood pressure (mmHg)\n133.7 (17.3)\n134.2 (16.3)\n133.7 (17.6)\n133.5 (17.8)\n133.4 (16.9)\n133.8 (17.5)\n\n\nDiastolic blood pressure (mmHg)\n81.9 (10.4)\n83.8 (10.1)\n82.7 (10.2)\n81.7 (10.6)\n82.1 (10.2)\n80.6 (10.3)\n\n\nPulse rate (bpm)\n67.4 (10.9)\n77.7 (11.2)\n72.6 (9.3)\n67.9 (9.3)\n65.3 (9.3)\n60.0 (9.8)\n\n\nHbA1c (%)\n5.8 (0.5)\n5.9 (0.9)\n5.9 (0.6)\n5.8 (0.5)\n5.7 (0.4)\n5.7 (0.4)\n\n\nTriglycerides (mmol/L)\n1.3 (0.7)\n1.5 (0.9)\n1.4 (0.7)\n1.3 (0.6)\n1.2 (0.7)\n1.1 (0.6)\n\n\nTotal cholesterol (mmol/L)\n5.4 (1.1)\n5.2 (1.0)\n5.4 (1.2)\n5.4 (1.1)\n5.4 (1.0)\n5.4 (1.0)\n\n\nHDL cholesterol (mmol/L)\n1.6 (0.4)\n1.6 (0.4)\n1.5 (0.5)\n1.6 (0.4)\n1.6 (0.4)\n1.6 (0.4)\n\n\nLDL cholesterol (mmol/L)\n3.2 (1.0)\n3.0 (1.0)\n3.2 (1.1)\n3.2 (1.0)\n3.3 (0.9)\n3.3 (0.9)\n\n\nUrine albumin-creatine ratio (mg/g)\n25.9 (132.8)\n36.4 (105.9)\n47.9 (275.1)\n19.6 (48.2)\n19.4 (67.7)\n16.4 (36.3)\n\n\nvo2max\n26.6 (7.8)\n24.8 (7.5)\n24.8 (7.5)\n26.1 (6.8)\n27.0 (8.0)\n28.7 (8.7)\n\n\nrest_hr\n57.3 (7.3)\n67.8 (5.7)\n63.3 (5.0)\n58.4 (4.5)\n55.0 (4.2)\n49.8 (4.9)\n\n\nmed_any_anti_hypertensive\n753 (47%)\n88 (61%)\n149 (48%)\n216 (47%)\n147 (43%)\n153 (43%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2.2 Multiday HRV and MACE, heart failure, and all-cause mortality.\nThe mean multiday SDNN was 139.0 (32.3) ms, and the mean heart rate was 73.5 (9.1) bpm. In the fully adjusted model, SDNN per SD was associated with a lower incidence rate ratio (IRR) for MACE 0.82 (CI: 0.69; 0.97), heart failure 0.76 (CI: 0.58; 0.99), and mortality rate ratio of 0.79 (CI: 0.66; 0.94). When I pre-adjusted for resting heart rate, the proportion of the association explained between HRV and MACE, HF, and all-cause mortality was 14%, 25%, and 19%, respectively. I included knots in the model, which showed that the risk became higher when SDNN fell below 120 to 110 ms (approximately below the 20th percentile), suggesting a potential cut-off point for higher risk. I therefore calculated the incidence rate (IR) at SDNN levels of 100 ms, 120 ms, and 160 ms, respectively, and plotted these as a function of age.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.2: Multiday SDNN levels (100 ms, 120 ms, 160 ms) by age-specific incidence rates for A) major adverse cardiovascular events, B) heart failure, and C) all-cause mortality\n\n\n\nAt age 65, the IR per 1000 person-years for MACE was 44.2 (CI: 33.5; 58.3) at SDNN = 100 ms, which was higher than the rates observed at SDNN = 120 ms (IR: 37.6 [CI: 29.2; 48.3]) and SDNN = 160 ms (IR: 34.7 [CI: 27.0; 44.5]) (Figure 5.2 A). The IR became higher with age, reaching its peak at age 72. For heart failure at age 65, the IR was 20.5 (CI: 15.3; 27.5) at SDNN = 100 ms, slightly higher than at SDNN = 120 ms (IR: 19.6 [CI: 14.8; 25.9]) and SDNN = 160 ms (IR: 19.8 [CI: 15.0; 26.2]) (Figure 5.2 B). The IR remained stable until age 70, after which it became higher. For all-cause mortality at age 65, the IR was 11.6 (CI: 6.3; 21.4) at SDNN = 100 ms, higher than at SDNN = 120 ms (IR: 7.6 [CI: 4.3; 13.3]) and SDNN = 160 ms (IR: 6.0 [CI: 3.4; 10.4]) (Figure 5.2 C). The IR for all-cause mortality became higher with age.\n\n\n5.2.3 Hourly HRV and MACE, heart failure, and all-cause mortality.\nFrom the hourly recordings, I observed a clear periodicity in SDNN, heart rate, sleep patterns, and physical acceleration. Mean (SD) SDNN increased from 5–6 AM (70.2 [28.8] ms), peaking at 8–9 AM (92.1 [29.0] ms), followed by a gradual decline, reaching its lowest point around 2 AM the next day (64.1 [28.1] ms). A similar circadian pattern was observed in heart rate, although its peak occurred two hours later, starting at 9 AM (76.7 [10.9] bpm). After peaking, heart rate remained stable throughout the afternoon before gradually decreasing.\nIn Figure 5.3, I observe hourly SDNN (preadjusted for heart rate and physical acceleration), heart rate, and physical acceleration association. Models was adjusted for age, sex, education, alcohol consumption, smoking behavior, BMI, total cholesterol, and Hba1c. The morning response of SDNN was most indicative of MACE, with the strongest association observed from 6–7 AM (IRR: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.71 to 1.00 per SD higher SDNN) (see Figure 5.3 A).Heart rate between 12 AM and 6 AM showed a small trend toward higher risk of MACE (IRR range: 1.11 to 1.15 per SD higher heart rate), although none of the confidence intervals exceeded one (see Figure 5.3 D). Across all hours, there was a plausible association between SDNN and heart failure. However, this association disappeared after adjusting for physical acceleration and heart rate (see Figure 5.3 B). In contrast, heart rate between 10 PM and 9 AM was associated with heart failure (IRR range: 1.37 to 1.58 per SD higher heart rate) (see Figure 5.3 E). SDNN was consistently associated with all-cause mortality across all hours, with a stronger inverse association observed between 12 PM and 1 AM (IRR range: 0.79 to 0.88 per SD higher SDNN) (see Figure 5.3 C). No clear trends of association were observed between heart rate and all-cause mortality.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.3: Hourly SDNN levels (100 ms, 120 ms, 160 ms) by age-specific incidence rates for A) major adverse cardiovascular events, B) heart failure, and C) all-cause mortality.

    "text": "5.3 Study III\n\n5.3.1 Descriptive\nIn study III, 179 participants with type 2 had measures of NT-proBNP and performed the CART test. CAN was present in 30% (n = 54) of participants (36% among those with valid CAN measurements (Figure 5.4 A)). Meanwhile, 24% (n = 43) were unable to complete the CART assessment adequately, primarily due to irregular heart rhythms (n = 8) or insufficient air pressure during the Valsalva manoeuvre (n = 21). Compare to those without CAN, the participants with CAN were more women (41 % vs 33 %), were more sedentary (45% vs 36%), had a higher proportion with prior major CVD (41% vs 20%) and declined eGFR (&lt; 60) (36% vs 22%), higher levels of triglyceride (median 2.05 mmol/L vs 1.95 mmol/ L), were slightly older (median 62 years vs 61 years), had longer duration of type 2 diabetes (median 19 years vs 15 years), and higher use SGTL2-inhibitors (65% vs 60%) but lower use of GLP-1 RA (63% vs 70%). No other difference in clinical characteristic was observed.\n\n\n5.3.2 CAN and indicators of heart failure\nA greater proportion of individuals with CAN exhibited elevated NT-proBNP levels (&gt;125 pg/ml) (51.9%, n=52/78) compared to those without CAN (23.2%, n=26/112)(Figure 5.4 E). The fully adjusted odds ratio (OR) for elevated NT-proBNP in individuals with CAN was 5.69 (95% CI: 1.95; 18.49) relative to those without CAN. Among the cardiovascular autonomic reflex tests (CART), the Valsalva maneuver demonstrated the strongest association with NT-proBNP (OR 9.00, 95% CI: 2.88; 33.09; n=51/75), followed by deep breathing (OR 3.30, 95% CI: 1.17; 9.77; n=33/133) and orthostatic hypertension (OR 4.04, 95% CI: 1.27; 13.77; n=24/146). No significant association was identified for the lying-to-standing test (OR 0.80, 95% CI: 0.32; 1.97; n=54/108). After imputing missing CART data, the OR for CAN in relation to elevated NT-proBNP declined to 2.94 (95% CI: 1.37; 6.56). Sensitivity analyses, which excluded participants using beta-blockers or those with a history of CVD, resulted in a smaller sample size and wider confidence intervals, though the overall association remained unchanged. CAN was associated with elevated NT-proBNP in individuals both without (NYHA I; OR = 4.3, 95% CI: 1.1; 16.3) and with heart failure symptoms (NYHA ≥ II; OR = 16.4, 95% CI: 1.2; 222.0), though the interaction was not significant (p = 0.4). Similar associations were seen across WATCH-DM risk groups: very-low-to-moderate (OR = 6.1, 95% CI: 1.6; 23.5) and high-to-very-high (OR = 6.3, 95% CI: 0.83; 46.9). Participants with CAN had 1.7 (95% CI: 0.3 to 3.0) point higher WATCH-DM risk score compared to those without CAN. The OR of presenting with NYHA class II or higher was 5.51 (95% CI: 1.9 to 15.97) in the group with CAN.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.4: Relationship betweeen CAN and indicators for heart failure.
