## Strength and limitation

### Study design

*Cross-sectional design*

Studies I and III are based on cross-sectional data, with exposure and outcome measured within a three-month period. The main limitation of this design is that it does not allow us to determine whether the exposure led to the outcome or vice versa. As a result, we cannot establish temporarily or confirm whether changes in the outcome were caused by the exposure. However, based on prior evidence, we assume the direction of the studies based on physiological knowledge and in vivo studies. In Study I, we based our direction of the association based on longitudinal association based on data from Whitehall II study, showing steeper decrease in short-term HRV are associated with subsequent higher levels of cf-PWV [@schaarup2023]. Moreover, \[insert in vivo studies\]. In Study II, we attempted to mimic temporarily by glucose metabolism, in individuals with type 2 diabetes and without known type 2 diabetes, instead of time, which shows deterioration of glucose metabolism increases the size of the association. The strength of study I, is that sample size is large, making our results more generalisable to wider populations across statuses of glucose metabolism.

In study III, our study design are more focused on the clinical diagnosis of CAN and presence of heart failure. This the question are more focused on clinical utilization of CAN in detecting type 2 diabetes patients who early progress towards heart failure, and thus the aetiological question remain for other study design. Indeed, whether cardiac function progressively worsens due to the etiological mechanisms of CAN remains to be fully established. If confirmed, this would underscore the relevance of CAN as a preclinical marker for early progression to heart failure, one that may be effective to target in efforts to prevent or delay the development of overt heart failure.

*Longitudinal design*

A major strength of study II is its longitudinal design, where HRV was measured at baseline and outcomes were captured prospectively through national registries. This temporal structure ensures that the exposure (HRV) clearly preceded the outcome, reducing the risk of reverse causation. Although repeated measurements of HRV over time would provide more detailed insights into autonomic function dynamics, the prospective design still allows for stronger inference of directionality than cross-sectional studies. Furthermore, the use of high-quality registry data for outcome ascertainment ensures complete follow-up and minimizes loss to follow-up bias.

Based on our studies, we demonstrate first steps in relationship between cardiovascular autonomic function, measured by, HRV or CART, we can only establish an association and cannot conclude with certainty that improvements in HRV measures lead to a reduction in cardiovascular risk. Therefore, we cannot ascertain causal effect based on our findings, and more causal focused methods are needed. Mendelian randomization, which uses genetic instruments for exposure, could help address this causal question. Furthermore, structured mediation analysis involving modification, e.g. by medication or lifestyle, would improve HRV or CART leads to reduction in cardiovascular risk, using data from intervention studies.

### Intern validity

In this project, we aimed to assess cardiovascular autonomic function both in free-living conditions and in response to standardized test procedures during clinical visits. Additionally, we used dynamic measurements to evaluate arterial stiffness locally and by velocity and biomarker assessments to determine the presence of heart failure. In this section, I will discuss the validity of 24-hour, week-long, and hourly HRV measurements, as well as the standardized tests of CAN. Furthermore, I will address the validity of the included outcomes. I will as well discuss using the strength and limitation of using MACE as an time to event outcome.

#### Long-term HRV (\>24 hours) as measurement for autonomic function

\[Actiheart and Holter monitor\]

HRV has been applied across several research domains. For example, in psychology as a marker of mental stress, in exercise physiology as an indicator of recovery, in cardiovascular research as a marker of autonomic dysfunction as a consequence to cardiac complications, and in diabetes research as a marker of autonomic neuropathy. In the context of this project, which focuses on long-term HRV in diabetes and cardiovascular research, it is important to acknowledge that the autonomic nervous function we aim to assess, may also be influenced by behavioral factors such as physical activity, sleep, meal timing, emotions, smoking, caffeine intake, alcohol consumption, use of medication, and prior cardiovascular complications which can potentially masking or mimicking underlying physiological dysfunction during recordings. Therefore, reduced long-term HRV cannot be interpreted solely as a marker of autonomic function. Moreover, HRV is also influenced by lifestyle patterns over time, making it sensitive not only to acute behaviors but also to long-term habits that affect autonomic balance. In study II, we observed that the lower ranges of HRV had both lower habitual physical activity and lower VO~2~ max, suggesting that lower HRV reflects more sedentary lifestyle and lower cardiorespiratory fitness.

In study I and II, we strived to account for habitual physical activity, while in study II, we also accounted hourly HRV for physical movement during the recording to test the influence of concurrent physical activity. However, further studies are need to understand how lifestyle patterns affect the long-term recording the subsequent day, to understand the behavioral component in long-term HRV. In study I and II, we also excluded participants with prior CVD to ensure that in order to keep etiological order between autonomic dysfunction and the outcome of cardiovascular complication.

Anti-hypertensive medications, especially beta-blockers, are known to increase HRV in randomized controlled trials [@niemel√§1994]. However, in cohort studies, participants using anti-hypertensives generally show lower HRV, likely reflecting their higher burden of cardiovascular complications \[ref\]. Because beta-blockers target the autonomic nervous system, some anti-hypertensive medications may introduce bias in HRV measurements, as they interfere with the autonomic function we aim to assess. In the sensitivity analysis in study I and III, without participants on anti-hypertensive treatment, the estimates did not materially change, thus we included the population and adjusted for medication in the full model

HRV levels are influenced by heart rate as lower resting heart rate allows higher variability. In study I, we chose not to adjust for heart rate in our models, as doing so could introduce issues of multicollinearity. Additionally, elevated heart rate is driven by increased sympathetic activity and may act as a mediator in the pathway leading to arterial stiffness. Our use of full-day recordings captures HRV during both rest and activity, providing a robust representation of autonomic function over the course of a typical day. In contrast, heart rate correction may be more relevant for short-term recordings of HRV, where standardized conditions can be affected by random influences such as time of day, smoking, or caffeine intake, which have been relevant for study III if we had included HRV measures. In Study II, we included HRV measures pre-adjusted for heart rate, which accounted for part of the observed associations, particularly with heart failure and all-cause mortality, but to a lesser extent for ischemic-related CVD events. Similar trends were observed in the hourly associations, where heart rate pre-adjustment had comparable effects on the outcomes.

[When HRV is analyzed in shorter segments (e.g., hourly or in 5-minute intervals), measures like RMSSD, pNN50, and HF appear to offer new insights into autonomic function and its relevance in diabetes and CVD, e.g during night-time [@hadad2021][@chellappa2025]. SDANN and SDNNi aim to reduce the impact of short-term variability, such as that caused by physical activity, by calculating either the standard deviation of 5-minute segment mean IBI (SDANN) or the mean of standard deviations across 5-minute segments (SDNNi). \[include lower-frequency points\]. This helps smooth out transient fluctuations and better capture long-term autonomic modulation. Thus, behavioral patterns pose a limitation in physiological research aiming to disentangle the causal pathways between autonomic dysfunction and CVD when using long-term HRV measures. These patterns likely introduce high variability between observations that is not attributable to autonomic function itself.]

\[\[HRV is just a proxy for heart rate, controversy?\] - HRV is just a proxy for heart rate - direct sympathetic activity at the location, but a proxy from heart rate signals.\]

#### Cardiovascular autonomic reflex test

CART offers a practical approach to screening for autonomic dysfunction, as the test has been shown to be reliable [@fleischer2011]. While some CART indices may be influenced by the time of day or recent physical activity, these effects are generally considered minimal. Additionally, no impact of caffeine intake on the reference age-based formular has been observed [@hansen2025].

#### Measures of cardiovascular risk

\[ Arterial stiffness - NT-proBNP - MACE limitation in aetiological research - Non-specific heart failure and MI and stroke and death - HRV stronger link with MI or stroke - Perspective: decreasing number of events with prolonging time-to-event - Clinical trail moved to high risk population in lower-income countries (South America) - Challenge for coming observational cohorts (need to increase sample size) \[The Problem With Composite End Points in Cardiovascular Studies The Story of Major Adverse Cardiac Events and Percutaneous Coronary Intervention\]\]

### External validity

#### Selection bias

**The Maastricht Study**

In Study I, participants were recruited using different strategies, with a focus on enrolling individuals with type 2 diabetes to ensure sufficient statistical power in this group. Recruitment was conducted through mass media campaigns, municipal registries, and the regional Diabetes Patient Registry via mailings. Thus, participation depended on individuals‚Äô awareness of the campaigns and their willingness to attend. Patients with type 2 diabetes were actively targeted with additional mail invitations to encourage participation.

**ADDITION-PRO**

In Study II, participants were recruited through a step-wise screening procedure. First, they were selected based on a risk score by self-administrated questionnaire sent by mail , followed by HbA1c or random glucose measurements. These procedures introduce different steps for selection bias as people have both to receive and sent a filled questionnaire, followed by a visit for blood testing if their risk score was high [@christensen2004].

First, the population consists of participants who responded to the screening questionnaire and those at higher risk who underwent further blood measurements. Second, the questionnaire itself selects participants based on a risk score developed to identify individuals with type 2 diabetes, while prediabetes identification was based on further measurement on the basis of HbA1c measurements. Certain risk factors, such as age and hypertension, contribute to higher risk by influencing the risk score, and thus may lead to high representation of these groups.

Hence, selection bias arises from both participation in the risk score assessment and follow-up attendance in ADDITION, as well as from the instruments used to identify risk, the Inter-99 risk score, HbA1c, and random blood glucose measurements. Healthier people are more attentive in screening and cohort studies \[ref.\].

**CANCAN**

In Denmark, patients with type 2 diabetes are referred to diabetes specialists at outpatient clinics when their general practitioner is unable to stabilize their diabetes care. As a result, CANCAN participants represent a higher-risk group in Danish diabetes patients, where more stable patients remain under general practitioner care. Consequently, the prevalence of heart failure indicators and CAN is likely higher in this selected group. The strength of the CANCAN sampling strategy in outpatient clinics is that patients were referred to an endocrinologist and attended their consultations. The additional study examination did not require extra transport or appointments but only involved additional time during their visit, with the option of receiving feedback on continuous glucose monitoring.

Overall in this project, the selection bias span across different aspects. In Study I-II, healthier and more health-conscious individuals tend to participate in cohort studies, potentially introducing selection bias. In contrast, attendance in the study III was more successful, as participation was optimized by scheduling study assessments during routine consultations. In epidemiology, we aim to match the source population with our target population. However, limitations due to self-selection in participation arise. Consequently, this can affect the results, as participants may be healthier and better using health care services, leading to less contrast between determinants and outcomes in our etiological analysis. We suspect that one explanation for the lack of a stepwise increase in the association between HRV and arterial stiffness across prediabetes and type 2 diabetes in study II is that the participants with type 2 diabetes represent a well-treated population. Although, the included participants may be sufficient to demonstrate a relationship, the magnitude of the association in groups with type 2 diabetes may be limited.

#### Generalisability

The generalizability of our findings can be discussed on two levels: the extent to which the results apply to the general population within the country and how they translate to populations with different ancestries in other countries.

Studies II‚ÄìIII include individuals at high risk of diabetes and those with type 2 diabetes. Therefore, the associations between cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction and cardiovascular outcomes or surrogate biomarkers extend to individuals with some degree of diabetes risk. However, whether these associations hold in the general populations remains uncertain. Study I suggests that the link between autonomic dysfunction and cardiovascular risk, as measured by arterial stiffness, is also present in individuals with normal glucose metabolism, though to a lesser extent. This finding was further supported by replication in the Whitehall II cohort, strengthening the generalizability of the observed relationship[@schaarup2023].

The study populations in Studies II‚ÄìIII consist of individuals of Nordic descent, while Study I represents a population of Western European descent. Since the constellation of risk factors for diabetes varies and may manifest differently in population with Asian, South American, African, and other decent, and therefore our findings may not be fully generalizable to these groups. This limitation affects the applicability of the observed associations and their magnitudes to a unknown degree. Further cohort studies including under-represented populations are warranted. As we are studying diabetes risk, all participants in the study were older adults aged 40 years and above. Therefore, our findings are limited to this age group, and whether the results extend to younger adults or children remains to be confirmed. Overall, while our study has the strength of including individuals across different levels of diabetes risk, some limitations in generalizability remain, particularly to more diverse and younger populations.

## Discussion of results

The challenges of population of type 2 diabetes and the risk of developing diabetes are addressed at multiple levels within the healthcare system.

-   Public health focuses on preventing diabetes and its complications across all age groups, from childhood to older adulthood.

-   Primary care, especially general practitioners, plays a central role in identifying individuals at risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. General practitioners also manage patients with uncomplicated type 2 diabetes.

-   Outpatient clinics, led by endocrinologists, are responsible for treating patients with more advanced stages of diabetes and for managing complex cases.

The aim of this thesis is to understand how cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction and CAN affects the risk of cardiovascular disease across stage of glucose metabolism. We included conditions such as heart failure, stroke, and myocardial infarction, as well as subclinical markers like carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity and carotid artery distensibility. The thesis includes populations across from normal glucose metabolism to type 2 diabetes and considers individuals engaged at different levels of the healthcare system. This chapter discusses the results and conclusions in relation to existing evidence and addresses their clinical implications across the levels of the health care system.

To address this aim, we used three different cohorts that reflect various levels of prevention and care. In Study I, we approached the question from a public health perspective by using data from The Maastricht Study including individuals aged 40 and above, representing all stages from normal glucose metabolism to type 2 diabetes. In this broader population, we demonstrated a link between lower 24-hour HRV and cardiovascular risk, measured by arterial stiffness. This association was modified by glucose metabolism, showing a stronger relationship in individuals with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes.

This led to a focus on individuals at higher risk of developing diabetes, using data from the ADDITION-PRO cohort. Individuals with prediabetes may benefit from structured guidance in primary care to prevent progression to type 2 diabetes and related complications such as CVD. In study II, we showed in a population with prediabetes, that lower multiday HRV was linked to higher risk of CVD, heart failure and all-cause mortality.

A key challenge in managing type 2 diabetes lies in the complexity of clinical decision-making, which is often applied uniformly across a heterogeneous patient population. As the duration of diabetes increases, the disease typically progresses, leading to a higher prevalence of both microvascular and macrovascular complications. This raises the need to early identify subgroups of individuals who may benefit from more structured and personalized treatment strategies based on their risk profile. However, to support such an approach, reliable and standardized tools are required to accurately detect and classify high-risk phenotypes. To uncover this perspective, we collected data for the CANCAN study, which included individuals with type 2 diabetes who were referred to secondary care at an outpatient clinic by general practitioners. In Study III, we showed among individuals with type 2 diabetes that those with CAN had higher heart failure risk, measured by elevated NT-proBNP levels, and this association remained significant in subgroups without heart failure symptoms or with low-to-moderate HF risk score.

Cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction, indicated by lower HRV or abnormal values in CARTs, is linked with cardiovascular risk across all stage of glucose metabolism. In the next section we will discuss potential mechanism and explore the clinical utility of HRV and CART in different stages of diabetes risk.

### Cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction impact on heart disease across glucose metabolism

Based on our studies, we have shown that cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction, measured by HRV and CART, is associated with CVD risk glucose metabolism by measures of arteriosclerosis, atherosclerosis events, all-cause mortality, and heart failure in people at high risk of diabetes, as well as indications of heart failure in patients with type 2 diabetes.

#### Arteriosclerosis

Earlier studies have shown an association between autonomic dysfunction, as measured by short-term HRV during rest, and arterial stiffness[@angelaberos2023]. In Study I, we extended perspective of long-term HRV, we demonstrated that autonomic dysfunction, as measured by 24-hour HRV, is associated with arterial stiffness measured both dynamically (pulse wave velocity) and locally (carotid distensibility). This suggest that autonomic response to free-living conditions contribute to the development of arterial stiffness.

:::

Arterial stiffness is not only a structural marker of vascular ageing but is also dynamically modulated by local endothelial signals and autonomic nervous system activity. Several studies have demonstrated a link between elevated sympathetic tone and increased arterial stiffness.Two possible mechanisms might explain how autonomic nervous function is related to arterial stiffness. First, autonomic nervous dysfunction may increase the vascular tone of large arteries, thereby impairing arterial elasticity Animal studies support this notion. In rats, proper autonomic regulation has been shown to be essential for maintaining aortic elasticity, and heightened sympathetic activity has been shown to damage elastin fibres, resulting in stiffer arteries. While such findings cannot be directly extrapolated to humans, they suggest plausible biological pathways. Second, the autonomic nervous system regulates heart rate and cardiac contractility. Autonomic dysfunction typically manifests as both reduced HRV and elevated resting heart rate. \[Arterial shear stress increases as a result of heightened sympathetic activity and parasympathetic withdrawal.\] A higher resting heart rate may contribute to arterial stiffness by altering blood flow dynamics and increasing shear stress. Our earlier study using data from the Whitehall II cohort showed that a steeper decrease in short-term (5min) HRV over a ten-year period was linked with higher levels of aortic stiffness in the subsequent five years [@schaarup2023].

Our data from Study I, extended this perspective by showing that the association between cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction and arterial stiffness is modified by dysglycemia, suggesting that the autonomic nervous system may lie on the pathway from dysglycemia to the development of arterial stiffness, even before the onset of type 2 diabetes. Data from Whitehall II showed how aortic stiffness have a steeper increase by higher HbA1c values among non-diabetic individuals [@mceniery2017]. In the subpopulation in Study I without diabetes, we observed modification by HbA1c in both aortic and carotid stiffness. The modifying effect of by HbA1c, suggest an amplified impact of hyperglycemia on the consequences of autonomic dysfunction. While several time-domain and frequency-domain HRV measures based on the global distribution were modified by diabetes status, the association of mean IBI was not. This suggests that the deterioration of HRV indicators may reflect a different pathogenesis of arterial stiffness in diabetes risk compared to heart rate.

#### Atherosclerosis

In Study II, we showed that individuals with a preclinical stage of autonomic dysfunction, measured by week-long HRV face a higher risk of incident ischemic-related cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and all-cause mortality.

Multiple mechanisms may explain how autonomic dysfunction contributes to the initiation and progression of ischemic events and stroke. First, as discussed in Study II, autonomic dysfunction may promote arteriosclerosis, leading to arterial stiffness. This stiffness impairs vasodilation and may enhance vasoconstriction, increasing hemodynamic stress and the risk of plaque rupture and thrombus formation [@bentzon2014]. In this context, findings from Study II may not entirely separate between arterial stiffness and atherosclerosis, which was been showed by data from the Rotterdam Study [@vanpopele2001]. As plaques develop, the associated increase in sympathetic nerve density around the arteries could reduce arterial elasticity. In a smaller study of people with type 2 diabetes, it was shown that lower HRV was linked with increase in carotid atherosclerosis [@gotts√§ter2006].

Second, the autonomic nervous system innervates the adventitia layer of blood vessels, where it modulates vascular tone via sympathetic fibers. Although atherosclerotic plaques form in the intima layer, recent in vivo studies have demonstrated that increased plaque burden is associated with higher local sympathetic nerve density, likely mediated by neuroinflammatory processes. Notably, reducing sympathetic innervation has been shown to attenuate plaque formation in animal models [@mohanta2022]. These findings suggest that autonomic dysfunction may not only reflect but also actively contribute to atherogenesis.

Third, the basis of autonomic nervous dysfunction has show to interfere with signalling pathway controlling the heart rhythm and thus lead to arrhythmias disturbing contraction of the heart. Data from the Atherosclerosis Risk In Communities study of illustrated that lower short-term HRV was associated with incident atrial fibrillation over 20 years, and the risk was higher among participants with type 2 diabetes [@agarwalsunilk.2017]. This supports autonomic dysfunctions role in the development of arrhythmogenesis which increase the risk of MI and stroke. However, in Study II, we do not have incident atrial fibrillation included as an outcome, therefore it would be needed to be explored to understand whether it could explain the higher risk of MACE. A study of individuals with coronary artery disease showed that stress-induced HRV was associated with myocardial infarction, even more than resting HRV, suggesting that a lower modulation of heart rate by parasympathetic response under stress may play a role in ischemia [@osei2024]. In our week-long recordings, our data likely included episodes of stress-induced HRV under free-living circumstances, e.g. the first indication observed during the awakening stages in the morning. Hence, capturing autonomic responses to living circumstances and their alignment with the circadian rhythm may provide valuable information about cardiovascular risk. Therefore, understanding autonomic responses to tasks is relevant for comprehending their role in cardiovascular risk, beyond short-term measures taken at rest. Including data to monitor real-time activity, such as physical activity, would bring additional value to capture physiological responses to bodily demands. This could enable the inclusion of heart rate responses (e.g., from rest to standing) and other relevant measures of autonomic function, such as heart rate recovery after physical movement, which is a known risk factor for CVD and all-cause mortality [@colechristopherr][@vandevegte].

#### Heart failure

The relationship between cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction and heart failure is complex [@shen2014]. On one hand, autonomic dysfunction may represent complication of that contributes to cardiac stress, sympathetic overactivation, and eventual heart failure. On the other, it may reflect the progression of cardiac remodeling and declining cardiac output. Our findings demonstrated the relationship between autonomic dysfunction and heart failure both cross-sectionally in population with type 2 diabetes and prospectively in people representing different tiers of risk of diabetes. However, our data are limited in determining the extent to which the relationship points toward one explanation or the other, as we lack baseline and follow-up measures of both heart failure and HRV.

Findings from Study I confirmed the relationship between autonomic dysfunction and arterial stiffness. It is well known that arterial stiffness is linked to cardiac remodelling, as increased pulse wave velocity leads to an earlier return of the reflected pulse wave to the aorta, which increases cardiac afterload and reduces coronary perfusion pressure [@boutouyrie2021]. Therefore, arterial stiffness may have an indirect effect on heart failure, potentially driven by autonomic dysfunction. However, structured analyses are needed to confirm these pathways, for example through mediation analysis to assess the direct and indirect effects of autonomic dysfunction. In study II, we observed that week-long HRV was linked with incident heart failure and a fourth of the risk was explained by resting heart rate. Data from the Rotterdam Study showed that short-term HRV was longitudinally associated with echocardiographic measures reflecting systolic function, suggesting autonomic dysfunction contributes to cardiac remodelling [@arshi2022]. In contrast to MACE outcomes, findings from Study II showed no specific time point in hourly HRV associated with heart failure. Instead, it was the overall daily pattern captured by week-long HRV that was linked to heart failure risk. This suggests that the association is not driven by isolated shifts in autonomic activity, but rather by a consistently impaired autonomic balance in free-living conditions. The effect appears to be driven in part by a failure to show appropriate decreases in heart rate during rest, as individuals with higher hourly heart rates at night had an increased risk of heart failure.

\[Study III: NT-proBNP\]

We cannot exclude the possibility that autonomic dysfunction represents an elevated demand for compensatory mechanisms as heart failure progresses. Studies have shown that patients with heart failure and lower HRV tend to have a worse prognosis of mortaltity. If low HRV or the presence of CAN were primarily driven by existing cardiac complications, it would suggest that individuals with these conditions exhibit more pronounced sympathetic overactivity as a consequence of heart failure progression, and thus reverse causation. Hence, elevated sympathetic activity during rest may indicate a greater reliance on compensatory mechanisms to maintain cardiac output. More precise measures are needed to assess sympathetic activity as primary driver of heart failure or secondary compensating mechanism of cardiac dysfunction. In addition, it remains unclear to what extent the parasympathetic nervous system can act as a protective mechanisms to counterbalance sympathetic dominance, and whether a decline in the balance of HRV reflects a breakdown. The two pathways, autonomic neuropathy and cardiac remodelling, are not mutually exclusive and may interact in a reinforcing cycle. Autonomic dysfunction can lead to increased sympathetic tone and reduced parasympathetic modulation, placing the heart under chronic stress and promoting structural and functional changes. In turn, cardiac remodeling may impair autonomic regulation, further exacerbating the imbalance. This interplay may create a self-perpetuating loop that accelerates the progression of heart failure. However, this remains beyond the scope of our current data and analysis.

### Clinical implications

We have discussed the utility of different cohorts representing public health, primary care, and secondary care in addressing the impact of autonomic dysfunction on cardiovascular disease, as well as the possible mechanisms involved. We will now focus on the clinical implications of using autonomic dysfunction in the prevention of cardiovascular disease. If long-term HRV or CART is to be considered for improving risk stratification, it remains important to determine at what stage in the progression of diabetes risk, and at which level of care, autonomic dysfunction becomes meaningful for early detection and intervention.

#### Public health

A preventive strategy for cardiovascular disease is the identification and treatment of high-risk individuals[@rose2008]. Public health approaches complement this by promoting healthy lifestyles, ensuring early screening for risk factors, and improving access to essential care and medications.

Studies I and II demonstrated a strong association between long-term HRV and CVD risk, with particularly pronounced associations in individuals with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. These findings suggest that HRV metrics could serve as early indicators for stratifying individuals who may benefit from preventive interventions. In the Whitehall II study, we further showed that a steeper 10-year decline in 5-minute HRV was associated with greater aortic stiffness development over the subsequent five years [@schaarup2023]. Thus, a declining HRV trend detected by smartwatches may help identify individuals who require more intensive interventions.

Previous studies have demonstrated associations between HRV and arterial stiffness in individuals with type 1 and type 2 diabetes [@angelaberos2023]. Building on this, our earlier work in the Whitehall II study showed that a steeper decline in HRV was linked to the development of arterial stiffness, even among individuals without type 2 diabetes [@schaarup2023]. In Study II, we extended this perspective by examining a general population across the full spectrum of glucose metabolism. Our findings revealed that autonomic dysfunction, measured by long-term HRV, is consistently associated with arterial stiffness, regardless of glycemic status. In Study I, one SD lower HRV was equivalent to the effect of 2.7 additional years on pulse wave velocity and 1.6 years on carotid distensibility[@schaarup2024]. In Study II, long-term measures of HRV were strongly associated with cardiovascular risk, with an effect size equivalent to 4.5 additional years of aging for major adverse cardiovascular events and 2.2 to 2.4 years for heart failure per one SD (33 ms) lower in week-long SDNN intervals [@schaarup2024b]. Autonomic dysfunction is known to precede the development of hypertension [@schroeder2003][@mancia2014], which is an early major risk factor for subsequent cardiovascular disease. Our results support the role of HRV as a early marker of cardiovascular health, in the general population and among those with elevated cardiometabolic risk. As such, our studies suggest that monitoring CVD risk progression or remission through long-term HRV may be valuable.

A limitation of implementing HRV monitoring, especially for long-term recordings, has been the demanding equipment requirements, such as the need for ECG recorders like Holter monitors. In recent years, wearable devices have become increasingly popular among the general public [@dhingra2023]. These devices offer an easy, non-invasive way to collect heart rate and HRV data and to monitor their progression over time. Further challenges include ensuring accurate measurement of interbeat intervals and determining which HRV indices are most suitable as markers of cardiovascular health. In diabetes and cardiovascular research, 24-hour HRV measures of indices reflecting heart rate responses to in- and expiration such as RMSSD, HF and pNN50 are more sensitive to behavioral influences and therefore have not consistently shown strong associations with cardiovascular or metabolic outcomes, compared to measures based of total variability (SDNN, SDANN, TP, ULF, VLF, LF) [@rinaldi2023][@coopmans2020][@schaarup2024]. However, the utility of these respiration-related indices appears to improve when measured during rest in shorter segments, such as 5-minute recordings(ref.).

If HRV monitoring proves effective by helping individuals maintain healthy, age-adjusted HRV range through lifestyle changes, and by prompting healthcare use in response to sustained deterioration of HRV, then HRV could become a meaningful marker for long-term health monitoring. A key public health challenge in integrating wearable devices into healthcare is ensuring equitable access, as individuals from lower socioeconomic groups are significantly less likely to own or use such devices. This raises the risk of health disparities by overlooking high-risk populations with lower income or education levels. Despite these concerns, there is encouraging evidence that the general population is open to digital health innovations. Studies have shown that the majority of the general population is willing to share their health data with public health institutions and to allow algorithm-based systems, such as artificial intelligence, in collaboration with healthcare professionals, to monitor disease[@dhingra2023][@schaarup2023a]. Therefore, monitoring HRV through wearable devices may serve as a first step in tracking health status and facilitating timely referrals to primary care when risk levels increase.

#### Primary care

Cardiovascular risk in primary care is assessed using clinical evaluations and standardized risk prediction tools to identify individuals at elevated risk (ref.). Management focuses on lifestyle modification, pharmacological therapy, and regular monitoring to reduce cardiovascular events (ref.). As the clinical paradigm shifts from a focus on ischemia toward more preventive strategies targeting atherogenesis, greater attention is being paid to individual risk factors that predispose patients to plaque formation [@zaman]. Individuals with prediabetes live with an elevated cardiometabolic risk, particular ischemic CVD and heart failure[@cai2021a]. 

However, many remain in prediabetes or return to normoglycemia.Despite the increased risk, they often remain outside structured assessment pathways in primary care, highlighting a critical gap in preventive strategies. This underscores the need for early and precise risk assessment [@birkenfeld2024]. We will discuss our findings to evaluate the integration of autonomic function assessment into routine cardiovascular risk stratification, with a particular emphasis on individuals with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes.

A central question that arises is whether autonomic dysfunction can serve not only as a potential marker of underlying pathophysiology but also as a clinically useful risk indicator for CVD and heart failure. If so, it could help identify patients at higher risk and thereby improve risk stratification. This concept can be explored from two complementary perspectives. First, long-term measurements of HRV may enhance the precision of individual cardiovascular risk prediction when added to established clinical risk scores. Second, these measurements may help identify preclinical manifestations of cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction, enabling targeted interventions in a subgroup of patients to prevent future CVD.

This raises the question of whether incorporating long-term HRV into traditional cardiovascular risk models, such as the Systematic COronary Risk Evaluation 2 (SCORE-2) and the Framingham Risk Score, adds meaningful predictive value [@score2workinggroupandesccardiovascularriskcollaboration2021; @dagostino2008].Our findings in Study I support a potential added value of 24-hour HRV to arterial stiffness, which is considered a surrogate marker of cardiovascular disease risk. In Study II, we extended this perspective by demonstrating a link between multiday HRV and hard endpoints of CVD and heart failure. However, our findings are based on associations and do not include prediction of outcomes[@varga2020]. Therefore, a limitation of our study is that we did not evaluate whether incorporating long-term HRV or CARTs into established risk scores improves detection compared to existing guidelines for cardiovascular disease and heart failure. While most biomarkers have shown limited incremental value beyond established predictors such as age, sex, lipid levels, diabetes status, and blood pressure, some studies suggest that 24-hour HRV may improve risk discrimination for cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality in individuals with type 2 diabetes [@cardoso2023], and for stroke in older adults [@bodapati2017]. However, a key limitation of these studies is that their reference models have not been calibrated or validated on a large scale cohorts, and in combination with established risk scores such as SCORE2 and the Framingham Risk Score.

Increasing availability of wearable devices capable of capturing long-term HRV data presents a practical opportunity for continuous monitoring in primary care settings. Wearable devices may facilitate earlier detection of autonomic dysfunction and support more personalized approaches to prevention and management of CVD risk. However, the clinical utility of stratifying patients based on preclinical autonomic dysfunction remains uncertain. These considerations are only actionable if interventions targeting autonomic function can be shown to reduce cardiovascular risk. Emerging evidence suggests that both pharmacological and lifestyle interventions can improve HRV in the short term [@chellappa2025; @picard2021]. For example, high-intensity interval training has been shown to improve autonomic function in obese individuals with and without type 2 diabetes, although benefits in HRV were observed only in those without diabetes [@b√∂nhof2022]. Similarly, lifestyle changes in individuals with prediabetes have been associated with improvements in short-term HRV, which may partly explain the reduction in diabetes risk independently of weight loss [@carnethon2006].

Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether these effects are sustainable over time and whether they translate into long-term cardiovascular protection. Particularly in the context of lifestyle improvements and intensified diabetes management, much of the observed enhancement in autonomic function may be mediated indirectly through improvements in cardiometabolic markers such as glucose levels, lipid profiles, body weight, maximal oxygen uptake, and blood pressure. Despite current uncertainties, monitoring autonomic function through long-term HRV may offer a valuable tool for assessing cardiovascular risk and tracking the impact of preventive strategies. However, its clinical utility must be confirmed through robust evidence demonstrating sustained effects and improved cardiovascular outcomes.

#### Secondary care

In secondary care, endocrinologists assess cardiovascular and heart failure risk management by integrating advanced diagnostics, biomarker analysis, and imaging to detect early dysfunction. Treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes is guided by evidence-based therapies and multidisciplinary collaboration. The ADA/EASD 2022 consensus of *Management of Hyperglycemia in Type 2 Diabetes* emphasizes that early detection of HF in individuals with T2D is crucial, as it enables timely initiation of therapies such as SGLT2i, which have demonstrated significant benefits in reducing HF-related outcomes [@davies2022]. A major challenge in diabetes care is detecting heart failure before symptoms appear, as patients with symptomatic heart failure face a higher risk of mortality and more frequent hospitalizations[@pop-busui2022]. The AHA, ACC, and HFSA 2022 guideline recommends identifying individuals at risk of heart failure based on factors such as diabetes, poor glycaemic control, uncontrolled hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, elevated body mass index, albuminuria, renal dysfunction, and a history of CVD [@heidenreich2022]. Still, there is a need to identify the optimal approach to recognize and diagnose heart failure in clinical care, as broad screening of echocardiography in type 2 diabetes is time-consuming and costly to perform [@pop-busui2022].

We demonstrated that CAN may help identify individuals at increased risk of heart failure, beyond what is captured by symptoms or existing risk scores. Therefore, our findings support considering CAN as a relevant risk factor for heart failure and suggest it may have value in future risk stratification strategies in type 2 diabetes. The clinical advantage on using CARTs is a standardized test under specific conditions. As we discusses, the tests is reliable and reproducible, with reference values in a large population[@hansen2025]. Beyond our findings and the established evidence of increased heart failure risk, CAN in the type 2 diabetes population also identifies individuals at high risk for cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, and early mortality. In Study III, we observed that two out of five participants had CAN, highlighting it as a prevalent complication. Therefore, detecting CAN may uncover an often-overlooked condition that is common in individuals with type 2 diabetes.

The clinical stratification of care includes two key considerations: (1) CAN should be further evaluated for associated cardiovascular complications, such as heart failure; and (2) cardiopreventive strategies should be initiated earlier in this subgroup.

First, patients with CAN may benefit from further cardiovascular assessment, such as the use of sensitive biomarkers or echocardiography. NT-proBNP is a strong predictor of heart failure and a validated biomarker for ruling out the condition (ref.). However, its specificity varies across heart failure phenotypes, being less specific for detecting HFpEF compared to HFrEF. Therefore, additional evaluation using echocardiography is warranted. Echocardiography not only helps classify heart failure phenotypes but also identifies preclinical stages of heart failure through the detection of functional or structural cardiac abnormalities. An important question remains: to what extent does CAN overlap with cardiac abnormalities identified via echocardiography? Including CAN in structured assessments of heart failure could help clarify this relationship. Determining the diagnostic and prognostic value of CAN, particularly its sensitivity and specificity in detecting HFrEF and HFpEF, requires further investigation.

Second, the presence of CAN may justify the earlier initiation of protective therapies. SGLT2 inhibitors are recommended as second-line treatment in type 2 diabetes and have demonstrated benefits in reducing the risk of heart failure, cardiovascular disease, and kidney function decline, complications commonly associated with CAN. Current guidelines recommend initiating these therapies based on a history of cardiovascular disease, heart failure or the presence of conventional high-risk CVD factors. However, the specific impact of SGLT2 inhibitors on the progression of cardiorenal outcomes in patients with CAN remains to be fully understood. Furthermore, while anti-hypertensive treatment is a cornerstone of cardiovascular risk management, whether specific classes of anti-hypertensive agents offer protective effects in patients with CAN remains to be explored.

The extent of our findings is limited in terms of clinical implications in Study III. First, the generalizability of our results is restricted, as our study population consists of patients with type 2 diabetes receiving secondary care. We observed that two out of five patients with CAN also had a history of cardiovascular disease, a group already at increased risk due to their diagnosis. This overlap may influence the interpretation of CAN as an independent risk factor. Therefore, our findings need to be validated in a broader population with type 2 diabetes, including individuals without a history of CVD. Doing so would allow for greater generalizability of our results to the broader type 2 diabetes population, particularly patients in primary care.
