The aim of this dissertation is to understand how cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction and CAN affect the risk of CVD across stages of glucose metabolism. Given the rising prevalence of prediabetes and T2D, and their association with increased risks of CVD and heart failure, there is a pressing need for earlier indicators to help healthcare providers intervene in a timely manner and prevent progression to more advanced stages of cardiovascular complications. One promising approach involves leveraging data from wearable devices and standardized screening tools. Heart rate dynamics and variability across different circumstances may hold promise as accessible indicators for early cardiovascular risk stratification.

This chapter presents a summary of the main findings from this dissertation, interpreted in the context of existing evidence in the field, and discusses their clinical relevance across different levels of healthcare. Moreover, the strengths and limitations of the methods and results will be discussed.

## Summary of findings

In this dissertation, autonomic dysfunction, defined by long-term HRV and standardized CARTs, and its relationship with cardiovascular complications were studied across three different cohorts representing populations at varying levels of prevention and care, including public health, primary care, and secondary care. In The Maastricht Study (Study I), I investigated autonomic dysfunction, measured by 24-hour HRV, and arterial stiffness, measured dynamically along the descending aorta and locally at the carotid site among individuals with NGM, prediabetes, and T2D. Lower HRV was associated with higher aortic and carotid stiffness. This association was evident regardless of glucose metabolism status, and was more pronounced in individuals with prediabetes or T2D. The modifying effect of dysglycemia was confirmed by a statistically significant stronger association across higher HbA1c levels. Z-scores of time- and frequency-domain measures showed the strongest associations, primarily driven by HRV indices reflecting total variation in interbeat intervals (SDNN, SDANN, SDNN index, ULF, VLF, TP).

Study II focused on individuals at higher risk of developing diabetes, using data from the ADDITION-PRO cohort. In study II, lower SDNN, measured over a multiple days, was associated with 18%, 24%, and 21% higher risk per SD for ischemic-related CVD, hospitalization of heart failure, and all-cause mortality, respectively. The risk became higher at SDNN levels below 120 ms, supported by a greater difference in incidence rates between individuals with 100 ms and 120 ms than the difference observed between individuals with 120 ms and 160 ms. Hourly measures suggested a specific time point related to ischemic-related CVD, as lower SDNN recorded between 6:00 and 7:00 AM was associated with MACE. Adjustment using the residuals method for concurrent heart rate and physical movement did not explain the observed association. Hourly SDNN was associated with all-cause MRR, although no specific time point showed an exceptionally strong association. While no association between hourly SDNN and heart failure was observed, higher heart rate during the night hours from 02:00 to 06:00 AM was linked to an higher risk of heart failure hospitalization.

These findings suggest that both long-term HRV measures and hourly HRV responses may serve as indicators of CVD risk. However, a key observation is that long-term HRV was assessed under free-living conditions, which restricts the comparability of results to standardized tests of autonomic function, although it provides insights that are more comparable to what may be found with long-term wearable devices. In the CANCAN Study (Study III), standardized CARTs were used to define CAN and to describe indicators of heart failure, including elevated NT-proBNP, WATCH-DM risk, and NYHA classification, among individuals with and without CAN in a population with T2D. In CANCAN, two out of five had CAN. Compared to individuals without CAN, theses individuals more often showed signs of heart failure, including elevated NT-proBNP levels, higher WATCH-DM risk scores, and higher classifications on the NYHA. CAN was association elevated NT-proBNP levels and these persisted even among individuals without heart failure symptoms based on NYHA classification, as well as among those categorized as having low to moderate heart failure risk according to the WATCH-DM score.

In summary, various aspects of autonomic dysfunction and cardiovascular complications were investigated in populations with normal glucose metabolism, prediabetes, or T2D. The overall findings showed that autonomic function, assessed through heart rate dynamics of long-term HRV and diurnal HRV or heart rate responses to reflex tests, is associated with an increased risk of CVD and heart failure. This relationship appears to be stronger in more severe stages of dysglycemia. Moreover, among individuals with T2D, the presence of CAN may help identify those at higher risk of heart failure, even in the absence of heart failure symptoms.

## Cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction and its impact on heart disease across glucose metabolism

This dissertation shows that autonomic dysfunction, measured by HRV and CARTs, is associated with CVD risk across the spectrum of glucose metabolism dysregulation. This association is evident with measures of arteriosclerosis, atherosclerotic events, all-cause mortality, and heart failure in individuals at high risk of diabetes, as well as with indicators of heart failure in patients with T2D.

#### Arteriosclerosis

In Study I, autonomic dysfunction, measured by 24-hour HRV, showed to be associated with arterial stiffness, measured both dynamically (cf-PWV) and locally (CD). This suggests that autonomic responses under free-living conditions contribute to the development of arterial stiffness. The majority of studies in the field have shown an association between autonomic dysfunction, as measured by short-term HRV during rest, and arterial stiffness in populations with either type 1 or T2D. [@angelaberos2023]. Study I extended this perspective by examining long-term HRV and focusing on a population without diabetes or prediabetes.

Arterial stiffness is not only a structural marker of vascular ageing but is also dynamically modulated by local endothelial signals and autonomic nervous system activity. Several studies have demonstrated a link between elevated sympathetic tone and increased arterial stiffness[@casey2011][@nardone2020]. Two possible mechanisms may explain how autonomic dysfunction is related to arterial stiffness. First, autonomic dysfunction may increase the vascular tone of large arteries, thereby impairing arterial elasticity dynamically. This concept is supported by animal studies. In rats, proper autonomic regulation has been shown to be essential for maintaining aortic elasticity. Based on this mechanism, the association between autonomic dysfunction and arterial stiffness might be considered an immediate, and likely transient effect, expected to reverse if autonomic function is restored. Conversely, chronic overstimulation of sympathetic activity can lead to structural remodeling and increased arterial stiffness[@mangoni1997]. While such findings cannot be directly extrapolated to humans, they suggest plausible biological pathways. Although the initial effects of autonomic dysfunction are dynamic and amenable to change by intervention, they may become progressively less reversible over time[@mangoni1997][@zhongjiesun2015]. Second, the autonomic nervous system regulates heart rate and cardiac contractility. Autonomic dysfunction typically manifests as both reduced HRV and elevated resting heart rate. Arterial shear stress increases as a result of heightened sympathetic activity and parasympathetic withdrawal. A higher resting heart rate may contribute to structurally stiffer arteries by altering blood flow dynamics and by increasing shear stress. Our earlier study using data from the Whitehall II cohort showed that a steeper decrease in short-term (5-minute) HRV over a ten-year period was linked with higher levels of aortic stiffness in the subsequent five years [@schaarup2023].

The association between 24-hour HRV and arterial stiffness (Study II) was modified by dysglycemia, suggesting dysclycemia may induce CAN that can affect arterial stiffness, even before the onset of T2D[@kuehl2012][@shah2019][@coopmans2020a]. Data from the Whitehall II study showed that aortic stiffness increased more steeply with higher HbA1c values among non-diabetic individuals[@mceniery2017], supporting this notion. In the subpopulation in Study I without diabetes, a modification by HbA1c in both aortic and carotid stiffness was observed. The modifying effect of HbA1c suggests that hyperglycaemia amplifies the consequences of autonomic dysfunction.

#### Atherosclerosis

Study II showed that individuals with a preclinical stage of autonomic dysfunction, measured by multiday HRV, face a higher risk of incident ischemic CVD, heart failure, and all-cause mortality.

Multiday HRV was assessed to capture autonomic activity in real-life settings across several days. Our results are consistent with earlier research linking lower HRV (including measures from 10 seconds to 24 hours) to CVD and mortality [@orini2023][@hillebrand2013]. Our findings build on existing evidence by (1) focusing on a population at elevated risk of diabetes, (2) utilizing multiday HRV recordings, and (3) identifying specific periods within the day where HRV patterns were indicative of ischemic-related CVD risk. By using both week-long and hourly data, we identified specific periods that provide a better indication of long-term risk. A strength of using multiday HRV recordings, is to provide more robust insights into individual autonomic patterns by averaging autonomic responses across typical daily conditions. This reduces the influence of random fluctuations caused by factors such as physical activity, emotional states, or sleep on any single day[@rietz2024].

Multiple mechanisms may explain how autonomic dysfunction contributes to the initiation and progression of ischemic events and stroke. First, as discussed in Study I, autonomic dysfunction may promote arteriosclerosis, leading to arterial stiffness through a dynamic and potentially modifiable process. Arterial stiffness impairs vasodilation, increasing hemodynamic stress and the risk of plaque rupture and thrombus formation [@bentzon2014][@zieman2005]. In this context, findings from Study I may not entirely distinguish between arterial stiffness and atherosclerosis, as shown by data from the Rotterdam Study[@vanpopele2001]. As plaques develop, the associated increase in sympathetic nerve density around the arteries could transiently reduce vascular tone which over time reduce arterial elasticity[@holwerda2019]. In a smaller study of people with T2D, lower HRV was linked with increased carotid atherosclerosis [@gottsäter2006].

Second, the autonomic nervous system innervates the adventitia layer of blood vessels, where it modulates vascular tone via sympathetic fibres. Although atherosclerotic plaques form in the intima layer, recent in vivo studies have demonstrated that increased plaque burden is associated with higher local sympathetic nerve density, likely mediated by neuroinflammatory processes. Notably, reducing sympathetic innervation has been shown to attenuate plaque formation in animal models[@mohanta2022]. These findings suggest that autonomic dysfunction may not only reflect but also actively contribute to atherogenesis.

Third, autonomic nervous dysfunction has been shown to interfere with signalling pathways controlling heart rhythm, potentially leading to arrhythmias that disturb cardiac contraction. Ealier studies have shwon lower short-term HRV was associated with incident atrial fibrillation, with a higher risk among participants with T2D [@orini2023][@agarwalsunilk.2017]. This supports the role of autonomic dysfunction in arrhythmogenesis, which increases the risk of myocardial infarction and stroke. Study II did not include atrial fibrillation as an outcome due to limitations in Danish registries, which often do not distinguish between short- and long-term AF, thereby affecting diagnostic validity. Future research is needed to explore whether it could explain the higher risk of major adverse cardiovascular events.

A study of individuals with coronary artery disease showed that stress-induced HRV was associated with myocardial infarction, even more than resting HRV, suggesting that lower parasympathetic modulation of heart rate under stress may play a role in ischemia [@osei2024]. Our study focused on long-term HRV under free-living conditions, capturing stress-responsive periods such as morning awakening. These recordings likely reflect underlying autonomic dynamics relevant to cardiovascular risk. A Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) in the UK biobank of short-term HRV supports this by identifying mechanisms involving G-protein signaling, pacemaker activity, and mitochondrial function as likely mediators of the genetic contribution to HRV. These pathways influence vagal control, cardiac excitability, and energy metabolism[@nolte2017]. Although derived from short-term recordings, these genetic associations may reflect autonomic traits that persist across different time scales, and reinforce the notion of a biological basis for inter-individual differences in HRV, preceding and independent of the onset of dysglaecemia. A Mendelian randomization study using data from the Rotterdam Study found that genetically predicted HRV was associated with an higher risk of atrial fibrillation[@geurts2023]. However, this association did not extend to all-cause mortality or cardiovascular death in the UK Biobank cohort, where only phenotypically measured HRV showed a significant relationship with these outcomes[@tegegne2023]. Interestingly, the genetic determinants of HRV exhibited pleiotropic relationships with several autonomic traits, including resting heart rate, heart rate response during exercise, and post-exercise recovery dynamics[@tegegne2023]. No GWAS has yet been conducted for long-term HRV. Therefore, it is unclear whether the genetic influences identified for short-term HRV are applicable to long-term HRV. Future GWAS efforts targeting long-term HRV could help establish causal relationships to CVD by leveraging methods such as Mendelian randomization, and advancing our understanding of the genetic architecture underlying autonomic regulation under a full day.

#### Heart failure

The relationship between cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction and heart failure is complex [@shen2014]. On one hand, autonomic dysfunction contributes to cardiac remodelling and eventual heart failure. On the other hand, it may reflect compensatory mechanisms of the progression of cardiac remodelling and declining cardiac output. Our findings demonstrated a relationship between autonomic dysfunction and heart failure both cross-sectionally in a population with T2D and prospectively in individuals representing different tiers of diabetes risk. However, our data are limited in determining the extent to which this relationship supports one explanation over the other, as we lack baseline and follow-up measures of both heart failure and HRV. Earlier studies have demonstrated that both short-term and long-term HRV are associated with incident heart failure in populations with and without T2D.[@patel2017][@kaze2022][@ostrowska2024][@shah2013]. Beyond examining a population at elevated risk of diabetes using multiday HRV recordings, we expanded previous research by (1) unmasking the role of resting heart rate in the relationship between HRV and heart failure risk, and (2) identifying specific times of day when heart rate patterns signaled higher risk of heart failure.

Several mechanisms may underlie the role of autonomic dysfunction in advancing heart failure. Findings from Study I confirmed the relationship between autonomic dysfunction and arterial stiffness. It is well established that arterial stiffness is linked to cardiac remodelling, as increased cf-PWV leads to an earlier return of the reflected pulse wave to the aorta, which increases cardiac afterload and reduces coronary perfusion pressure [@boutouyrie2021]. Therefore, autonomic dysfunction may have an indirect effect on heart failure, potentially mediated by arterial stiffness. However, structured analyses are needed to confirm these pathways. For example, through mediation analysis to assess the direct and indirect effects of arterial stiffness, with autonomic dysfunction as the main determinant. In Study II, I observed that multiday HRV was associated with incident heart failure, and approximately one-fourth of the risk was explained by resting heart rate. Data from the Rotterdam Study showed that short-term HRV was longitudinally associated with echocardiographic measures reflecting systolic function, suggesting that autonomic dysfunction contributes to cardiac remodelling [@arshi2022]. In contrast to MACE outcomes, findings from Study II showed no specific time point in hourly HRV that was associated with heart failure. Instead, it was the overall daily pattern captured by multiday HRV that was linked to heart failure risk. This suggests that the association is not driven by isolated shifts in autonomic activity in response to circadian stressors, but rather by a consistently impaired autonomic balance under free-living conditions. The effect appears to be driven in part by a failure to show appropriate decreases in heart rate during rest, as individuals with higher hourly heart rates at night had an higher risk of heart failure. In Study III, I observed that individuals with CAN had higher risk of elevated levels of NT-proBNP, a biomarker of myocardial stress and early heart failure. Therefore, CAN is associated with hemodynamic consequences that contribute to both structural and functional cardiac remodeling, which in turn leads to elevated NT-proBNP levels.

We cannot exclude the possibility that autonomic dysfunction represents an elevated demand for compensatory mechanisms as heart failure progresses. Studies have shown that patients with heart failure and lower HRV tend to have a worse prognosis in terms of mortality. If low HRV or the presence of CAN were primarily driven by existing cardiac complications, it would suggest that individuals with these conditions exhibit more pronounced sympathetic overactivity as a consequence of heart failure progression, indicating potential reverse causation. Hence, elevated sympathetic activity during rest may reflect a greater reliance on compensatory mechanisms to maintain cardiac output. More precise measures are needed to assess whether sympathetic activity acts as a primary driver of heart failure or as a secondary compensatory response to cardiac dysfunction. In addition, it remains unclear to what extent the parasympathetic nervous system can act as a protective mechanism to counterbalance sympathetic dominance, and whether a decline in HRV reflects a breakdown of this balance. The two pathways (autonomic neuropathy and cardiac remodelling) are not mutually exclusive and may interact in a reinforcing cycle. Autonomic dysfunction can lead to increased sympathetic tone and reduced parasympathetic modulation, placing the heart under chronic stress and promoting structural and functional changes[@ritchie2020]. In turn, cardiac remodelling may impair autonomic regulation, further exacerbating the imbalance. This interplay may create a self-perpetuating loop that accelerates the progression of heart failure. However, this remains beyond the scope of our current data and analysis.

## Clinical implications

The dissertation investigates autonomic dysfunction in populations ranging from normal glucose metabolism to T2D and yields insights relevant for individuals who engage with the healthcare system at different levels. No specific role has yet been defined for autonomic dysfunction in clinical decision-making within healthcare, as current treatment and intervention options specifically targeting autonomic function remain limited. Despite the fact that the results do not point directly to where and how implementation of autonomic dysfunction in clinical practice may make sense, the included studies broadly represent situations relevant to public health, primary care, and secondary care settings. In the following section, the clinical implications of using autonomic dysfunction in the prevention of CVD will be discussed. If long-term HRV or CARTs are to be considered for improving risk stratification, it is important to determine at what stage in the progression of diabetes risk, and at which level of care, autonomic dysfunction becomes meaningful for early detection and intervention.

### Public health

A central strategy in preventing CVD is the early identification and multifactorial treatment of individuals at high risk[@rose2008]. Public health initiatives support this by promoting healthy lifestyles, facilitating early screening for risk factors, and improving access to essential care and medications. Long-term HRV may enhance these efforts by identifying individuals with elevated cardiovascular risk and by tracking their physiological response to lifestyle changes.

Evidence from Study I showed that lower long-term HRV was associated with increased arterial stiffness, as measured by cf-PWV and CD, even in individuals without T2D. One standard deviation lower HRV corresponded to the effect of 2.7 additional years of ageing on aortic stiffness (cf-PWV) and 1.6 years on carotid stiffness (CD)[@schaarup2024]. These cross-sectional findings suggest that HRV may serve as a marker of early vascular aging and cardiovascular risk. Supporting this, the Whitehall II study demonstrated a longitudinal relationship between short-term HRV and aortic stiffness. Together, these findings highlight the potential of HRV as a indicator of vascular health.

Within the public health setting, individuals with prediabetes represent a particularly vulnerable group at risk for comorbidities[@yafeiwu2025]. They often fall between structured care pathways, sometimes encouraged to reassess their cardiovascular risk at more frequent intervals, other times not offered any additional measures or attention beyond general lifestyle advice. Notably, Studies I and II demonstrated that the associations between long-term HRV and CVD risk were especially pronounced in this population. In those at high risk of diabetes, a one standard deviation (33 ms) lower multiday SDNN was equivalent to 4.5 additional years of aging for ischemic-related CVD and 2.2 to 2.4 years for heart failure[@schaarup2024b]. On a population level, lower HRV (SDNN: 100 ms) in individuals with prediabetes was associated with a higher incidence rate of CVD, heart failure, and all-cause mortality compared to individuals with normal-to-higher HRV (SDNN: 120–160 ms). These findings reinforce the role of HRV as an early and sensitive marker of cardiovascular health in populations at cardiometabolic risk.

While these findings highlight HRV’s potential, practical implementation faces several challenges. Historically, long-term HRV monitoring has required specialized equipment such as Holter ECG recorders. However, the growing popularity of wearable devices offers a promising alternative. These devices provide a non-invasive, user-friendly way to collect heart rate and HRV data over time[@dhingra2023], under free-living conditions like those examined in Study II.

If HRV monitoring proves effective in helping individuals maintain a healthy, age-adjusted HRV range through lifestyle changes and prompts healthcare engagement when HRV deteriorates, it could become a meaningful tool for long-term health tracking. A cross-sectional study of 8 million individuals found that those who took more steps per day had higher HRV[@natarajan2020], suggesting that HRV may also reflect behavioral adaptation.

A major public health challenge lies in ensuring equitable access to wearable technology. Individuals from lower socioeconomic backgrounds are less likely to own such devices, raising concerns about health disparities. Despite this, there is encouraging evidence that the general population is receptive to digital health innovations. Many are willing to share health data with public institutions and support the use of AI in disease monitoring[@dhingra2023][@schaarup2023a].

Integrating wearable HRV monitoring into public health strategies could represent a transformative step in proactive cardiovascular care. It may support early detection, personalized prevention, and timely referral to primary care when risk levels increase.

### Primary care

Cardiovascular risk in primary care is assessed using clinical evaluations and standardized risk prediction tools to identify individuals at elevated risk. Management focuses on lifestyle modification, pharmacological therapy, and regular monitoring to reduce cardiovascular events[@sterling2024]. In this context, long-term HRV may offer added value by improving the precision of cardiovascular risk stratification and by serving as a marker to monitor the effectiveness of preventive strategies.

Long-term HRV may improve ranking of individual risk when added to established clinical risk scores. Tools such as SCORE2 and the Framingham Risk Score are widely used in primary care to guide cardiovascular risk assessment[@score2workinggroupandesccardiovascularriskcollaboration2021; @dagostino2008]. In Study I, models adjusted for conventional CVD risk factors supported the potential added value of 24-hour HRV in relation to arterial stiffness, a surrogate marker of CVD risk. Study II extended this perspective by demonstrating associations between multiday HRV and incident CVD and heart failure. However, these findings are based on associations and do not include formal prediction modeling[@varga2020], and therefore cannot determine whether incorporating long-term
HRV or CARTs into existing risk scores improves predictive performance beyond current guidelines. While most biomarkers have shown limited incremental value beyond established predictors (including age, sex, lipid profiles, diabetes status, and blood pressure), some studies suggest that 24-hour HRV may improve risk discrimination for CVD and all-cause mortality in individuals with T2D[@cardoso2023], and for stroke and heart failure in older adults[@patel2017][@bodapati2017]. However, these studies often lack calibration or validation in large-scale cohorts and have not been integrated with widely used risk scores such as SCORE2 or the Framingham Risk Score.

Long-term HRV may also help classify preclinical autonomic dysfunction, enabling targeted interventions in a subgroup of patients to prevent CVD. The increasing availability of wearable devices capable of capturing long-term HRV data presents a practical opportunity for continuous monitoring in primary care. These devices may facilitate earlier detection of autonomic dysfunction and support more personalized approaches to cardiovascular risk management. However, the clinical utility of stratifying patients based on preclinical autonomic dysfunction remains uncertain. These considerations are only actionable if interventions in this subgroup can be shown to reduce cardiovascular risk. Emerging evidence suggests that both pharmacological and lifestyle interventions can improve HRV in the short term[@chellappa2025; @picard2021]. For example, high-intensity interval training has been shown to improve autonomic function in obese individuals with and without T2D[@bönhof2022]. Similarly, lifestyle changes in individuals with prediabetes have been associated with improvements in short-term HRV, which may partly explain a reduction in diabetes risk independently of weight loss[@carnethon2006]. Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether these effects on HRV are sustainable over time and whether they translate into long-term cardiovascular protection. In many cases, improvements in autonomic function may be mediated indirectly through changes in cardiometabolic markers such as glucose levels, lipid profiles, body weight, maximal oxygen uptake, and blood pressure.

Despite these uncertainties, monitoring autonomic function through long-term HRV may offer a valuable tool for assessing cardiovascular risk and tracking the impact of preventive strategies. In Denmark, prediabetes, defined by HbA1c, is present in 7.1% of adults[@nicolaisen2023]. One in five of these individuals develops T2D within five years[@nicolaisen2023], while others either remain in the prediabetic stage or return to normoglycemia. Despite their higher risk of CVD and heart failure[@cai2021a], individuals with prediabetes are not captured by existing preventive strategies. This underscores the need for early and precise risk assessment[@birkenfeld2024]. Given that the cardiovascular consequences of autonomic dysfunction appear to be more pronounced in individuals with prediabetes compared to those with normoglycemia, HRV has the potential to help identify those at elevated CVD risk within this group. However, evidence demonstrating improved risk prediction and sustained effects leading to better cardiovascular outcomes is needed to establish its relevance for integration into primary care.

### Secondary care

In secondary care, endocrinologists assess cardiovascular and heart failure risk by integrating advanced diagnostics, biomarker analysis, and imaging to detect early heart failure, guided by symptoms and risk profiles. The treatment of patients with T2D is guided by evidence-based therapies and multidisciplinary collaboration. The ADA/EASD 2022 consensus on Management of Hyperglycemia in T2D emphasizes that early detection of heart failure in individuals with T2D is crucial, as it enables timely initiation of therapies such as SGLT2 inhibitors, which have demonstrated significant benefits in reducing heart failure-related outcomes [@davies2022]. A major challenge in diabetes care is detecting heart failure before symptoms appear, as patients with symptomatic heart failure face a higher risk of mortality and more frequent hospitalizations [@pop-busui2022]. The AHA, ACC, and HFSA 2022 guidelines recommend identifying individuals at risk of heart failure based on factors such as diabetes, poor glycaemic control, uncontrolled hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, elevated BMI, albuminuria, renal dysfunction, and a history of CVD [@heidenreich2022]. Still, there is a need to identify optimal approaches for recognizing and diagnosing heart failure in clinical care, as broad echocardiographic screening in T2D is time-consuming and costly [@pop-busui2022].

Study III demonstrated that CAN may help identify individuals at higher risk of heart failure, beyond what is captured by symptoms or existing risk scores. Our findings support considering CAN as a relevant risk factor for heart failure and suggest it may have value in future risk stratification strategies in T2D. A clinical advantage of using CARTs is that they are standardized tests performed under controlled conditions. CARTs have proven to be reliable and reproducible, with reference values established in large population studies [@hansen2025]. Beyond these findings and the established evidence of increased heart failure risk, CAN also identifies individuals at high risk for overall CVD, kidney disease, and early mortality in the T2D population[@mahinchowdhury2021][@tang2023]. In Study III, I observed that two out of five participants had CAN, highlighting it as a complication with considerable prevalence. Therefore, detecting CAN may uncover an often-overlooked condition that is common in individuals with T2D.

Clinical stratification of care includes two key considerations: (1) CAN should be further evaluated for associated cardiovascular complications, such as heart failure; and (2) cardiopreventive strategies should be initiated earlier in this subgroup.

First, patients with CAN may benefit from further cardiovascular assessment, including the use of sensitive biomarkers or echocardiography. NT-proBNP is a strong predictor of heart failure and a validated biomarker for ruling out the condition (ref.). However, its specificity varies across heart failure phenotypes, being less specific for detecting HFpEF compared to HFrEF. Therefore, additional evaluation using echocardiography may be warranted. Beyond classifying heart failure phenotypes, echocardiography identifies preclinical stages of heart failure through the detection of functional or structural cardiac abnormalities. Including CAN in structured assessments of heart failure could help clarify to which extent CAN overlaps with cardiac abnormalities. Determining the diagnostic and prognostic value of CAN, particularly its sensitivity and specificity in detecting HFrEF and HFpEF, requires further investigation.

Second, the presence of CAN may justify earlier initiation of protective therapies. SGLT2 inhibitors are recommended as second-line treatment in T2D and have demonstrated benefits in reducing the risk of heart failure, CVD, and kidney function decline, complications commonly associated with CAN. Current guidelines recommend initiating these therapies based on a history of CVD, heart failure, or the presence of conventional high-risk cardiovascular factors. However, the specific impact of SGLT2 inhibitors on the progression of cardiorenal outcomes in patients with CAN remains to be fully understood. Furthermore, while antihypertensive treatment is a cornerstone of cardiovascular risk management, whether specific classes of antihypertensive agents offer protective effects in patients with CAN remains to be explored.

The direct clinical implications of our findings in Study III are limited. The generalizability of our results is restricted, as our study population consisted of patients with T2D receiving secondary care. Two out of five patients with CAN showed to have a history of CVD—a group already at higher risk of heart failure due to their prior diagnosis. This overlap may influence the interpretation of CAN as an independent risk factor. Therefore, these findings need to be validated in a broader population with T2D, including individuals without a history of CVD. Doing so would allow for greater generalizability of our results to the broader T2D population, particularly those visiting primary care.

## Strengths and limitations

### Study design

*Cross-sectional design*

Studies I and III are based on cross-sectional data, with exposure and outcome measured within a three-month period. The main limitation of this design is that it does not allow us to determine whether the exposure led to the outcome or vice versa. As a result, we cannot establish temporality or confirm whether changes in the outcome were caused by the exposure. Based on prior evidence, the direction of the associations in Study I was inferred using physiological knowledge and findings from epidemiological and in vivo studies[@schaarup2023].

Study III focused on the clinical diagnosis of CAN and the presence of heart failure. The research question was oriented toward the clinical utility of CAN in identifying patients with T2D who may be progressing early toward heart failure. Whether cardiac function progressively worsens due to the underlying mechanisms of CAN remains to be fully established.

*Longitudinal design*

A major strength of Study II is its longitudinal design, where HRV was measured at baseline and outcomes were captured prospectively through national registries. This temporal structure ensures that the exposure (HRV) preceded the outcome, reducing the risk of reverse causation. The prospective design allows for stronger inference of directionality than cross-sectional studies. Furthermore, the use of high-quality registry data ensures complete outcome ascertainment and minimizes loss to follow-up bias.

Causality cannot be ascertained from the findings in Study I and Study II, and more causally focused methods are needed. Mendelian randomization, which uses genetic instruments for exposure, could help address this question. Additionally, structured mediation analysis involving modifications such as medication or lifestyle changes could clarify whether improving HRV or CART reduces cardiovascular risk, using data from intervention studies.

### Internal validity

In this project, I aimed to assess cardiovascular autonomic function both in free-living conditions and in response to standardized test procedures during clinical visits. Additionally, I used dynamic measurements to evaluate arterial stiffness both locally and by velocity, and biomarker assessments to determine the presence of heart failure. In this section, I discuss the validity of 24-hour, multiday, and hourly HRV measurements, as well as the standardized tests of CAN. I also address the validity of the included outcomes and discuss the strengths and limitations of using MACE as a time-to-event outcome.

#### Long-term HRV (\>24 hours) as measurement for autonomic function

A main consideration in HRV analysis is the reliability of raw inter-beat interval data from ECG recordings. To ensure accurate various HRV measures, the intervals must be captured in a continuous and correctly sequenced manner. Frequency-domain analyses depend on the integrity of the inter-beat interval sequence, while some time-domain measures, such as RMSSD and pNN50, specifically quantify the variability in the differences between successive intervals.

In Study I, data from a 12-lead Holter system was used, which is considered the gold standard for long-term ECG recordings. With detailed and sequential inter-beat intervals, all HRV metrics were calcualted.

In Study II, data from the Actiheart device was used for HRV. The device was configured to record continuously over an 8-day period. It captured 30-second epochs of mean heart rate intervals, along with upper and lower prediction intervals. From each epoch, I generated a distribution of inter-beat intervals. An algorithm was applied to estimate HRV from these distributions, and its validation showed strong agreement with established metrics, including SDNN, SDANN, and the SDNN index [@taskforceoftheeuropeansocietyofcardiologythenorthamericansocietyofpacingelectrophysiology1996][@schaarup2024a]. However, a limitation of this dataset is that it did not allow for the calculation of frequency-domain measures or specific time-domain metrics such as RMSSD or pNN50. HF power, RMSSD, and pNN50 typically show earlier diurnal peaks compared to low-frequency power and SDNN[@natarajan2020]. These measures are more reflective of parasympathetic activity during in- and expiration. It remains to be determined how these hourly measures relate to CVD, heart failure, and all-cause mortality.

In the context of this study, which focuses on long-term HRV in free-living conditions, it is important to acknowledge that the autonomic nervous function we aim to assess may also be influenced by behavioral factors such as physical activity, sleep, meal timing, emotions, smoking, caffeine intake, alcohol consumption, medication use, and prior cardiovascular complications. These factors can potentially mask or mimic underlying physiological dysfunction during recordings, but they can also elicit the HRV responses we are interested in. Therefore, lower long-term HRV cannot be interpreted solely as a marker of autonomic function. HRV is also influenced by lifestyle patterns over time, making it sensitive not only to day-to-day behaviors but also to long-term habits that affect autonomic balance.

In Studies I and II, I accounted for habitual physical activity, and in Study II, I also adjusted hourly HRV for physical movement during recordings to test the influence of concurrent activity. However, further studies are needed to understand how lifestyle patterns affect long-term HRV recordings on subsequent days, in order to separate direct behavioural from physiological components. In both studies, I excluded participants with prior CVD to preserve the etiological order between autonomic dysfunction and cardiovascular outcomes.

Anti-hypertensive medications, especially beta-blockers, are known to increase HRV in randomized controlled trials [@niemelä1994]. However, in cohort studies, participants using anti-hypertensives generally show lower HRV, likely reflecting a higher burden of cardiovascular complications \[ref\]. Because beta-blockers target the autonomic nervous system, they may introduce bias in HRV measurements by interfering with the function. In sensitivity analyses in Studies I and III, excluding participants on anti-hypertensive treatment did not materially change the estimates. Therefore, these participants where kept and adjusted for medication use in the full models.

Beyond the behavioral and pharmacological contribution to HRV, we cannot physiologically distinguish whether autonomic dysfunction is primarily driven by increased sympathetic activity or reduced parasympathetic tone. Much of the current evidence on autonomic contributions to HRV originates from studies involving experimental manipulation of the autonomic nervous system, such as physiological tests (e.g., tilt response, deep breathing, stress reactivity) or pharmacological interventions. Therefore, it remains uncertain whether the mechanisms linking HRV indices to cardiovascular complications are predominantly due to sympathetic over activity or parasympathetic withdrawal.

HRV levels are influenced by heart rate, as lower resting heart rate allows for greater variability. In Study I, I chose not to adjust for heart rate in our models, as this could introduce multicollinearity. Additionally, elevated heart rate is driven by higher sympathetic activity and may act as a mediator in the pathway leading to arterial stiffness. Our use of full-day recordings captures HRV during both rest and activity, providing a robust representation of autonomic function over a typical day. In contrast, heart rate correction may be more relevant for short-term HRV recordings, where standardized conditions can be affected by random influences such as time of day, smoking, or caffeine intake. These factors would have been relevant in Study III had I included HRV measures. In Study II, I usesd the residuals method to pre-adjust HRV measures for resting heart rate, which accounted for part of the observed associations, particularly with heart failure and all-cause mortality, and to a lesser extent with ischemic-related CVD events.Similar trends were observed for hourly associations, where heart rate pre-adjustment had had comparable effects on the outcomes.

The three studies demonstrate approaches to identifying CVD risk: (1) selecting appropriate HRV indices, (2) segmenting time intervals, and (3) assessing heart rate variability under defined conditions. Our findings reveal varying associations across HRV indices, with RMSSD and HF showing weaker associations. However, previous research has shown that these indices can be informative when analyzed in 5-minute segments [@hadad2021; @chellappa2025]. Additionally, SDNN exhibited varying associations with CVD risk depending on the time of day. We also observed that, in CARTs, the Valsalva maneuver and deep breathing test were more indicative of heart failure. These insights highlight the need for methodological rigor in HRV research, particularly in aligning index selection and time segmentation with specific research objectives and clinical contexts.

#### Cardiovascular autonomic reflex test

CART provides a practical approach for screening for autonomic dysfunction and has been shown to be a reliable method [@fleischer2011]. Although certain indices from CARTs may be influenced by factors such as time of day or recent physical activity, these effects are generally minimal. Furthermore, no impact of caffeine intake has been observed on the reference age-based formula [@hansen2025]. A limitation of the CARTs in this study was the high prevalence of participants who were unable to complete the full battery of tests, primarily due to missing data from the Valsalva manoeuvre.

#### Measures of cardiovascular risk

In study I, arterial stiffness measures, including pulse wave velocity and carotid artery distensibility, are influenced by mean arterial pressure (MAP), which may confound the assessment of vascular stiffness. In Study I, we adjusted for MAP, which attenuated the observed associations. However, the associations remained statistically significant.

In Study II, outcomes were based on CVD events, heart failure, and causes of death from Danish national registries. Potential misclassification and underreporting, especially of heart failure, may have led to underestimation of associations[@dalsgaard2019].

In Study III, NT-proBNP was used as a primary indicator of heart failure. While NT-proBNP is a validated biomarker for early-stage heart failure and useful for ruling out the condition, its specificity varies by HF phenotype[@heidenreich2022]. Thus, we cannot determine HFpEF or HFrEF. Its diagnostic accuracy is influenced by factors such as atrial fibrillation, obesity, and kidney function[@heidenreich2022]. Individuals with atrial fibrillation were excluded by design. Analysis was adjusted for BMI, which did not affect the association between CAN and elevated NT-proBNP. After adjusting for eGFR, the association became stronger, suggesting that reduced kidney function may have masked the true link between CAN and heart failure risk.

### External validity

#### Selection bias

**The Maastricht Study**

The target population in Study I was intended to represent individuals at different stages of glucose metabolism. However, our analysis may be affected by selection bias in the representation of individuals with T2D. The Maastricht Study recruited participants who were able and willing to attend multiple research visits and receive personal health feedback, which likely attracted health-conscious individuals with higher education levels. As a result, participants with T2D were relatively healthy, with a median disease duration of three years and a low prevalence of complications. Those who completed both long-term ECG and arterial stiffness assessments may represent an even healthier subgroup. This selection bias may limit the generalizability of the findings to the broader T2D population and could explain why the effect modification did not differ step-wise from that observed in individuals with prediabetes.

**ADDITION-PRO**

The target population in Study II was intended to represent individuals at high risk of developing T2D. Participants were recruited through a stepwise screening procedure. Initially, individuals were selected based on a risk score derived from a self-administered questionnaire sent by mail. Those with high scores were invited for further testing using HbA1c or random glucose measurements.

This recruitment strategy involved selection by design, as it defined the source population based on specific risk criteria. The questionnaire prioritized risk factors such as older age and hypertension, leading to overrepresentation of these groups [@glümer2004]. Prediabetes was identified only after biochemical testing, while the risk score was primarily designed to detect undiagnosed T2D. Although this selection process was intentional and aligned with the ADDITION-PRO objectives, it may limit the generalizability of the findings to the broader population at risk for T2D.

In addition, selection bias may have occurred due to differential participation in the ADDITION screening program. Healthier individuals were more likely to participate, both by completing the risk questionnaire and by attending follow-up testing [@christensen2004]. As a result, the baseline risk for CVD in ADDITION-PRO participants may have been lower compared to the target population.

**CANCAN**

The target population in Study III was intended to represent individuals with type 2 diabetes treated in outpatient clinics. In Denmark, patients with type 2 diabetes are referred to diabetes specialists at outpatient clinics when their general practitioner is unable to stabilize their condition. A strength of the CANCAN sampling strategy is that patients were already attending endocrinology consultations, and the study examination required only additional time during their visit, without the need for extra transportation or appointments. Assessing selection bias in this study is challenging, as inclusion depended on referral practices by general practitioners [@olivarius1994]. These practices may vary individually, with differing thresholds for referring patients to specialized care based on clinical judgment and patient characteristics.

#### Generalisability

The generalisability of our findings is considered in the context of the targeted recruitment strategies used in each study, which aimed to include individuals across a spectrum of diabetes risk, from NGM to established type 2 diabetes. As a result, the findings are most applicable to populations with similar clinical profiles and healthcare settings.

Studies I-III include individuals at high risk of diabetes and those with T2D. Therefore, the associations between cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction and cardiovascular outcomes or surrogate biomarkers are relevant to individuals with some degree of diabetes risk and progressed T2D. Study I suggests that the link between autonomic dysfunction and cardiovascular risk, as measured by arterial stiffness, is also present in individuals with NGM, though to a lesser extent. This finding, supported by replication in the Whitehall II cohort[@schaarup2023], indicates that the observed relationship may extend beyond high-risk groups and into the general population. In study III, participants represent a higher-risk diabetes group among Danish diabetes patients, while more stable patients remain under general practitioner care. Consequently, the prevalence of heart failure indicators and CAN is likely higher in this selected group, than patients managed in primary care, and thus limits extending our finding to broader T2D populations.

By design, younger individuals with prediabetes or young-adult-onset type 2 diabetes are underrepresented in our studies. This group may be overlooked in current research and warrants further attention in future studies[@nicolaisen2023; @magliano2024]. The applicability of our findings to other countries may be influenced by differences in demographic composition, risk factor distributions, healthcare systems, and stages of economic development. These factors can affect both the prevalence of diabetes and cardiovascular disease and the nature of their associations. While our study populations were primarily of Nordic and Western European descent, differences in ethnic composition are only one of several factors that may influence external validity. These regions also share relatively well-organized, publicly funded healthcare systems, which may differ substantially from those in other parts of the world and further affect the applicability of our findings.
