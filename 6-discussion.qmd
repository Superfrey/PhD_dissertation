## Strength and limitation

### Study design

*Cross-sectional design*

Studies I and III are based on cross-sectional data, with exposure and outcome measured within a three-month period. The main limitation of this design is that it does not allow us to determine whether the exposure led to the outcome or vice versa. As a result, we cannot establish temporarily or confirm whether changes in the outcome were caused by the exposure. However, based on prior evidence, we assume the direction of the studies based on physiological knowledge and in vivo studies. In Study I, we based our direction of the association based on longitudinal association based on data from Whitehall II study, showing steeper decrease in short-term HRV are associated with subsequent higher levels of cf-PWV [@schaarup2023]. Moreover, \[insert in vivo studies\]. In Study II, we attempted to mimic temporarily by glucose metabolism, in individuals with type 2 diabetes and without known type 2 diabetes, instead of time, which shows deterioration of glucose metabolism increases the size of the association. The strength of study I, is that sample size is large, making our results more generalisable to wider populations across statuses of glucose metabolism.

In study III, our study design are more focused on the clinical diagnosis of CAN and presence of heart failure. This the question are more focused on clinical utilization of CAN in detecting type 2 diabetes patients who early progress towards heart failure, and thus the aetiological question remain for other study design. Indeed, whether cardiac function progressively worsens due to the etiological mechanisms of CAN remains to be fully established. If confirmed, this would underscore the relevance of CAN as a preclinical marker for early progression to heart failure, one that may be effective to target in efforts to prevent or delay the development of overt heart failure.

*Longitudinal design*

A major strength of study II is its longitudinal design, where HRV was measured at baseline and outcomes were captured prospectively through national registries. This temporal structure ensures that the exposure (HRV) clearly preceded the outcome, reducing the risk of reverse causation. Although repeated measurements of HRV over time would provide more detailed insights into autonomic function dynamics, the prospective design still allows for stronger inference of directionality than cross-sectional studies. Furthermore, the use of high-quality registry data for outcome ascertainment ensures complete follow-up and minimizes loss to follow-up bias.

Based on our studies, we demonstrate first steps in relationship between cardiovascular autonomic function, measured by, heart rate variability or CART, we can only establish an association and cannot conclude with certainty that improvements in HRV measures lead to a reduction in cardiovascular risk. Therefore, we cannot ascertain causal effect based on our findings, and more causal focused methods are needed. Mendelian randomization, which uses genetic instruments for exposure, could help address this causal question. Furthermore, structured mediation analysis involving modification, e.g. by medication or lifestyle, would improve HRV or CART leads to reduction in cardiovascular risk, using data from intervention studies.

### Intern validity

In this project, we aimed to assess cardiovascular autonomic function both in free-living conditions and in response to standardized test procedures during clinical visits. Additionally, we used dynamic measurements to evaluate arterial stiffness locally and by velocity and biomarker assessments to determine the presence of heart failure. In this section, I will discuss the validity of 24-hour, week-long, and hourly HRV measurements, as well as the standardized tests of CAN. Furthermore, I will address the validity of the included outcomes. I will as well discuss using the strength and limitation of using MACE as an time to event outcome.

#### Long-term HRV (\>24 hours) as measurement for autonomic function

\[Actiheart and Holter monitor\]

HRV has been applied across several research domains. For example, in psychology as a marker of mental stress, in exercise physiology as an indicator of recovery, in cardiovascular research as a marker of autonomic dysfunction as a consequence to cardiac complications, and in diabetes research as a marker of autonomic neuropathy. In the context of this project, which focuses on long-term HRV in diabetes and cardiovascular research, it is important to acknowledge that the autonomic nervous function we aim to assess, may also be influenced by behavioral factors such as physical activity, sleep, meal timing, emotions, smoking, caffeine intake, alcohol consumption, use of medication, and prior cardiovascular complications which can potentially masking or mimicking underlying physiological dysfunction during recordings. Therefore, reduced long-term HRV cannot be interpreted solely as a marker of autonomic function. Moreover, HRV is also influenced by lifestyle patterns over time, making it sensitive not only to acute behaviors but also to long-term habits that affect autonomic balance. In study II, we observed that the lower ranges of HRV had both lower habitual physical activity and lower VO~2~ max, suggesting that lower HRV reflects more sedentary lifestyle and lower cardiorespiratory fitness.

In study I and II, we strived to account for habitual physical activity, while in study II, we also accounted hourly HRV for physical movement during the recording to test the influence of concurrent physical activity. However, further studies are need to understand how lifestyle patterns affect the long-term recording the subsequent day, to understand the behavioral component in long-term HRV. In study I and II, we also excluded participants with prior CVD to ensure that in order to keep etiological order between autonomic dysfunction and the outcome of cardiovascular complication.

Anti-hypertensive medications, especially beta-blockers, are known to increase HRV in randomized controlled trials [@niemelä1994]. However, in cohort studies, participants using anti-hypertensives generally show lower HRV, likely reflecting their higher burden of cardiovascular complications \[ref\]. Because beta-blockers target the autonomic nervous system, some anti-hypertensive medications may introduce bias in HRV measurements, as they interfere with the autonomic function we aim to assess. In the sensitivity analysis in study I and III, without participants on anti-hypertensive treatment, the estimates did not materially change, thus we included the population and adjusted for medication in the full model

HRV levels are influenced by heart rate as lower heart rate allows higher variability. In study I, we chose not to adjust for heart rate in our models, as doing so could introduce issues of multicollinearity. Additionally, elevated heart rate is driven by increased sympathetic activity and may act as a mediator in the pathway leading to arterial stiffness. Our use of full-day recordings captures heart rate variability during both rest and activity, providing a robust representation of autonomic function over the course of a typical day. In contrast, heart rate correction may be more relevant for short-term recordings of HRV, where standardized conditions can be affected by random influences such as time of day, smoking, or caffeine intake, which have been relevant for study III if we had included HRV measures. In Study II, we included HRV measures pre-adjusted for heart rate, which accounted for part of the observed associations, particularly with heart failure and all-cause mortality, but to a lesser extent for ischemic-related CVD events. Similar trends were observed in the hourly associations, where heart rate pre-adjustment had comparable effects on the outcomes.

#### Cardiovascular autonomic reflex test

CART offers a practical approach to screening for autonomic dysfunction, as the test has been shown to be reliable [@fleischer2011]. While some CART indices may be influenced by the time of day or recent physical activity, these effects are generally considered minimal. Additionally, no impact of caffeine intake on the reference age-specific values was observed [@hansen2025].

#### Measures of cardiovascular risk

\[ Arterial stiffness - NT-proBNP - MACE limitation in aetiological research - Non-specific heart failure and MI and stroke and death - HRV stronger link with MI or stroke - Perspective: decreasing number of events with prolonging time-to-event - Clinical trail moved to high risk population in lower-income countries (South America) - Challenge for coming observational cohorts (need to increase sample size) \[The Problem With Composite End Points in Cardiovascular Studies The Story of Major Adverse Cardiac Events and Percutaneous Coronary Intervention\]\]

### External validity

#### Selection bias

**The Maastricht Study**

In Study I, participants were recruited using different strategies, with a focus on enrolling individuals with type 2 diabetes to ensure sufficient statistical power in this group. Recruitment was conducted through mass media campaigns, municipal registries, and the regional Diabetes Patient Registry via mailings. Thus, participation depended on individuals’ awareness of the campaigns and their willingness to attend. Patients with type 2 diabetes were actively targeted with additional mail invitations to encourage participation.

**ADDITION-PRO**

In Study II, participants were recruited through a stepwise screening procedure. First, they were selected based on a risk score by self-adminstrated questionnare sent by mail , followed by HbA1c or random glucose measurements. These procedures introduce different steps for selection bias as people have both to receive and sent a filled questionnaire, followed by a visit for blood testing if their risk score was high [@christensen2004].

First, the population consists of participants who responded to the screening questionnaire and those at higher risk who underwent further blood measurements. Second, the questionnaire itself selects participants based on a risk score developed to identify individuals with type 2 diabetes, while prediabetes identification was based on further measurement on the basis of HbA1c measurements. Certain risk factors, such as age and hypertension, contribute to higher risk by influencing the risk score, and thus may lead to high representation of these groups.

Hence, selection bias arises from both participation in the risk score assessment and follow-up attendance in ADDITION, as well as from the instruments used to identify risk—namely, the Inter-99 risk score, HbA1c, and random blood glucose measurements. Healthier people are more attentive in screening and cohort studies \[ref.\].

**CANCAN**

In Denmark, patients with type 2 diabetes are referred to diabetes specialists at outpatient clinics when their general practitioner is unable to stabilize their diabetes care. As a result, CANCAN participants represent a higher-risk group in Danish diabetes patients, where more stable patients remain under general practitioner care. Consequently, the prevalence of heart failure indicators and CAN is likely higher in this selected group. The strength of the CANCAN sampling strategy in outpatient clinics is that patients were referred to an endocrinologist and attended their consultations. The additional study examination did not require extra transport or appointments but only involved additional time during their visit, with the option of receiving feedback on continuous glucose monitoring.

Overall in this project, the selection bias span across different aspects. In Study I-II, healthier and more health-conscious individuals tend to participate in cohort studies, potentially introducing selection bias. In contrast, attendance in the study III was more successful, as participation was optimized by scheduling study assessments during routine consultations. In epidemiology, we aim to match the source population with our target population. However, limitations due to self-selection in participation arise. Consequently, this can affect the results, as participants may be healthier and better using health care services, leading to less contrast between determinants and outcomes in our etiological analysis. We suspect that one explanation for the lack of a stepwise increase in the association between HRV and arterial stiffness across prediabetes and type 2 diabetes in study II is that the participants with type 2 diabetes represent a well-treated population. Thus, the included participants may be sufficient to demonstrate a relationship, the magnitude of the association to the target population may be limited.

#### Generalisability

The generalizability of our findings can be discussed on two levels: the extent to which the results apply to the general population within the country and how they translate to populations with different ancestries in other countries.

Studies II–III include individuals at high risk of diabetes and those with type 2 diabetes. Therefore, the associations between cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction and cardiovascular outcomes or surrogate biomarkers extend to individuals with some degree of diabetes risk. However, whether these associations hold in the general populations remains uncertain. Study I suggests that the link between autonomic dysfunction and cardiovascular risk, as measured by arterial stiffness, is also present in individuals with normal glucose metabolism, though to a lesser extent. This finding was further supported by replication in the Whitehall II cohort, strengthening the generalizability of the observed relationship[@schaarup2023].

The study populations in Studies II–III consist of individuals of Nordic descent, while Study I represents a population of Western European descent. Since the constellation of risk factors for diabetes varies and may manifest differently in population with Asian, South American, African, and other decent, and therefore our findings may not be fully generalizable to these groups. This limitation affects the applicability of the observed associations and their magnitudes to a unknown degree. Further cohort studies including under-represented populations are warranted. As we are studying diabetes risk, all participants in the study were older adults aged 40 years and above. Therefore, our findings are limited to this age group, and whether the results extend to younger adults or children remains to be confirmed. Overall, while our study has the strength of including individuals across different levels of diabetes risk, some limitations in generalizability remain, particularly to more diverse and younger populations.

## Discussion of results

The challenges of population of type 2 diabetes and the risk of developing diabetes are addressed at multiple levels within the healthcare system.

-   Public health focuses on preventing diabetes and its complications across all age groups, from childhood to older adulthood.

-   Primary care, especially general practitioners, plays a central role in identifying individuals at risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. General practitioners also manage patients with uncomplicated type 2 diabetes.

-   Outpatient clinics, led by endocrinologists, are responsible for treating patients with more advanced stages of diabetes and for managing complex cases.

The aim of this thesis is to understand how cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction and CAN affects the risk of cardiovascular disease across stage of glucose metabolism. We included conditions such as heart failure, stroke, and myocardial infarction, as well as subclinical markers like carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity and carotid artery distensibility. The thesis includes populations across from normal glucose metabolism to type 2 diabetes and considers individuals engaged at different levels of the healthcare system. This chapter discusses the results and conclusions in relation to existing evidence and addresses their clinical implications across the levels of the health care system.

To address this aim, we used three different cohorts that reflect various levels of prevention and care. In Study I, we approached the question from a public health perspective by using data from The Maastricht Study including individuals aged 40 and above, representing all stages from normal glucose metabolism to type 2 diabetes. In this broader population, we demonstrated a link between lower 24-hour heart rate variability and cardiovascular risk, measured by arterial stiffness. This association was modified by glucose metabolism, showing a stronger relationship in individuals with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes.

This led to a focus on individuals at higher risk of developing diabetes, using data from the ADDITION-PRO cohort. Individuals with prediabtes may benefit from structured guidance in primary care to prevent progression to type 2 diabetes and related complications. In study II, we showed lower multiday HRV was linked to higher risk of CVD, heart failure and all-cause mortality.

A key challenge in managing type 2 diabetes lies in the complexity of clinical decision-making, which is often applied uniformly across a heterogeneous patient population. As the duration of diabetes increases, the disease typically progresses, leading to a higher prevalence of both microvascular and macrovascular complications. This raises the need to early identify subgroups of individuals who may benefit from more structured and personalized treatment strategies based on their risk profile. However, to support such an approach, reliable and standardized tools are required to accurately detect and classify high-risk phenotypes. To uncover this perspective, we collected data for the CANCAN study, which included individuals with type 2 diabetes who were referred to secondary care at an outpatient clinic by general practitioners. In this study (study III), we showed among individuals with type 2 diabetes that those with CAN had higher heart failure risk, measured by elevated NT-proBNP levels, and this association remained significant in subgroups without heart failure symptoms.

Cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction, indicated by lower HRV or abnormal values in CARTs, is linked with cardiovascular risk across all stage of glucose metabolism. In the next section we will discuss potential mechanism and explore the utility of HRV and CART in different stages of diabetes risk.

### Cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction impact on heart disease across glucose metabolism

Based on our studies, we have shown that cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction, measured by HRV and CART, is associated with CVD risk glucose metabolism by measures of arteriosclerosis, atherosclerosis events, all-cause mortality, and heart failure in people at high risk of diabetes, as well as indications of heart failure in patients with type 2 diabetes.

#### Arteriosclerosis

In Study II, we demonstrated that autonomic dysfunction, as measured by 24-hour HRV, is associated with arterial stiffness measured both dynamically (pulse wave velocity) and locally (carotid distensibility). Arterial stiffness is not only a structural marker of vascular ageing but is also dynamically modulated by local endothelial signals and autonomic nervous system activity. Several studies have demonstrated a link between elevated sympathetic tone and increased arterial stiffness.

Two possible mechanisms might explain how autonomic nervous function is related to arterial stiffness. First, autonomic nervous dysfunction may increase the vascular tone of large arteries, thereby impairing arterial elasticity. Animal studies support this notion. In rats, proper autonomic regulation has been shown to be essential for maintaining aortic elasticity, and heightened sympathetic activity has been shown to damage elastin fibres, resulting in stiffer arteries. While such findings cannot be directly extrapolated to humans, they suggest plausible biological pathways. Second, the autonomic nervous system regulates heart rate and cardiac contractility. Autonomic dysfunction typically manifests as both reduced heart rate variability and elevated resting heart rate. A higher resting heart rate may contribute to arterial stiffness by altering blood flow dynamics and increasing shear stress. Our earlier study using data from the Whitehall II cohort showed that a steeper decrease in short-term (5min) HRV over a ten-year period was linked with higher levels of aortic stiffness in the subsequent five years [@schaarup2023].

Our data from Study I, extended this perspective by showing that the association between cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction and arterial stiffness is modified by dysglycemia, suggesting that the autonomic nervous system may lie on the pathway from dysglycemia to the development of arterial stiffness, even before the onset of type 2 diabetes. Data from Whitehall II showed how aortic stiffness have a steeper increase by higher HbA1c values among non-diabetic individuals [@mceniery2017]. In the subpopulation in Study I without diabetes, we observed modification by HbA1c in both aortic and carotid stiffness. The modifying effect of by diabetes status, suggest an amplified impact of hyperglycemia on the consequences of autonomic dysfunction. While several time-domain and frequency-domain HRV measures based on the global distribution were modified by diabetes status, the association of mean IBI was not. This suggests that the deterioration of HRV indicators may reflect a different pathogenesis of arterial stiffness in diabetes risk compared to heart rate.

Earlier studies have shown an association between autonomic dysfunction, as measured by short-term HRV during rest, and arterial stiffness[@angelaberos2023]. In Study I, we extended perspective of but long-term HRV, does link with arterial stiffness, suggesting autonomic response to free-living conditions contribute to the development of arterial stiffness. In addition, we found that HRV was associated with locally measured carotid distensibility. However, our results are limited by the inability to distinguish between sympathetic and parasympathetic contributions to arterial stiffness, or to determine whether the observed risk is driven by specific responses to living conditions or circadian rhythm variations.

#### Atherosclerosis

In Study II, we showed that individuals with a preclinical stage of autonomic dysfunction, measured by week-long HRV face a higher risk of incident ischemic-related cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and all-cause mortality.

In the perspective of cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction, we see two possible mechanisms in the formation of ischemic events and stroke. First, autonomic dysfunction drives arteriosclerosis, stiffening the arteries and thereby inhibiting their elasticity [@schaarup2023]. Arterial shear stress increases as a result of heightened sympathetic activity and parasympathetic withdrawal. As a result, the vasodilation of coronary blood vessels may be inhibited, and an increase in vasoconstriction, which can contribute to plaque rupture and thrombus formation [@bentzon2014]. The autonomic nervous system reaches the adventitia layer, innervating the smooth muscles of blood vessels. Despite a separation between the atherosclerotic plaque in the intima layer and the surrounding nerves at the adventitia layer, recent in vivo animal studies have shown that higher plaque burden coexists with increased density of sympathetic nerves at local arteries through neuroinflammatory modulation. Furthermore, plaque formation can be lowered by reducing sympathetic nerve density [@mohanta2022]. In this context, findings from Study II suggest that arterial stiffness is not entirely separate from atherosclerosis, which was been confirm by data from the Rotterdam Study [@vanpopele2001]. As plaques develop, the associated increase in sympathetic nerve density around the arteries could reduce arterial elasticity. In a smaller study of people with type 2 diabetes, it was shown that lower HRV was linked with increase in carotid atherosclerosis [@gottsäter2006]. However, as was asses only nervous response through variation of heart beat, structured studies with precise measures of sympathetic activity are needed to test these hypotheses and confirm them in humans.

\[- Discuss what we actual see -\> wider range of heart rate lowers risk of cardiovascular complications and mortality..... Will be attempted to discuss 1) the actual mechanism between long-term and hourly HRV and CVD, and 2) potential mechanism of cardiovascular autonomic dysfunctions role in atherosclerosis.\]

A study of individuals with coronary artery disease showed that stress-induced HRV was associated with myocardial infarction, even more than resting HRV, suggesting that a missing modulation of heart rate by parasympathetic response under stress may play a role in ischemia [@osei2024]. In our week-long recordings, our data likely included episodes of stress-induced HRV under free-living circumstances, e.g. the first indication observed during the awakening stages in the morning. Hence, capturing autonomic responses to living circumstances and their alignment with the circadian rhythm may provide valuable information about cardiovascular risk. Therefore, understanding autonomic responses to tasks is relevant for comprehending their role in cardiovascular risk, beyond short-term measures taken at rest. Including data to monitor real-time activity, such as physical activity, would bring additional value to capture physiological responses to bodily demands. This could enable the inclusion of heart rate responses (e.g., from rest to standing) and other relevant measures of autonomic function, such as heart rate recovery after physical movement, which is a known risk factor for CVD and all-cause mortality [@colechristopherr.][@vandevegte].

\[Secondly, lower HRV may be a result of forming plaques that increase cardiac workload and density of sympathetic nerves. This means the autonomic dysfunction may reflect a predisposition of establish atheroma. \[more meat!!!!\]\]

Moreover the basis of autonomic nervous dysfunction has show to interfere with signalling pathway controlling the heart rhythm and thus lead to arrhythmias disturbing contraction of the heart. Data from the Atherosclerosis Risk In Communities study of illustrated that lower short-term HRV was associated with incident atrial fibrillation over 20 years, and the risk was higher among participants with type 2 diabetes [@agarwalsunilk.2017]. This supports autonomic dysfunctions role in the development of arrhythmogenesis which increase the risk of MI and stroke. However, in Study II, we do not have incident atrial fibrillation included as an outcome, therefore it would be needed to be explored to understand whether it could explain the higher risk of MACE.

In a shifting paradigm from a focus on ischemia towards more preventive strategies targeting atheroma, individual risk factors leading to a higher predisposition for plaque formation are receiving greater attention [@zaman]. As increased sympathetic nervous system activity has been linked to greater plaque formation, and may be modifiable by reducing sympathetic drive, the autonomic nervous system could play a role in reducing atherosclerotic thrombus formation. However, more physiological studies are needed to understand the mechanisms of atherosclerosis in the presence of autonomic nervous dysfunction, including the causal direction between the two, and how this interplay may be altered during the progression from normal glucose metabolism to type 2 diabetes. This requires more precise measures of both sympathetic and parasympathetic activity, as well as markers of endothelial dysfunction, beyond what is currently captured by HRV and common indices of arterial stiffness.

#### Heart failure

Heart failure is commonly classified as either ischemic or non-ischemic in origin. It may arise as a consequence of atherosclerosis, arteriosclerosis, or both, contributing to myocardial ischemia, pressure overload, and structural cardiac changes. The relationship between cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction and heart failure is likely complex [@shen2014]. On one hand, autonomic dysfunction may represent complication of that contributes to cardiac stress, sympathetic overactivation, and eventual heart failure. On the other, it may reflect the progression of cardiac remodeling and declining cardiac output. Our findings demonstrated the relationship between autonomic dysfunction and heart failure both cross-sectionally in population with type 2 diabetes and prospectively in people representing different tiers of risk of diabetes. However, our data are limited in determining the extent to which the relationship points toward one explanation or the other, as we lack baseline and follow-up measures of both heart failure and heart rate variability.

Findings from Study I confirmed the relationship between autonomic dysfunction and arterial stiffness. It is well known that arterial stiffness is linked to cardiac remodelling, as increased pulse wave velocity leads to an earlier return of the reflected pulse wave to the aorta, which increases cardiac afterload and reduces coronary perfusion pressure [@boutouyrie2021]. Therefore, arterial stiffness may have an indirect effect on heart failure, potentially driven by autonomic dysfunction. However, structured analyses are needed to confirm these pathways, for example through mediation analysis to assess the direct and indirect effects of autonomic dysfunction. In study II, we observed that week-long HRV was linked with incident heart failure and a fourth of the risk was explained by resting heart rate. Data from the Rotterdam Study showed that short-term HRV was longitudinally associated with echocardiographic measures reflecting systolic function, suggesting autonomic dysfunction contributes to cardiac remodelling [@arshi2022]. In contrast to MACE outcomes, findings from Study II showed no specific time point in hourly HRV associated with heart failure. Instead, it was the overall daily pattern captured by week-long HRV that was linked to heart failure risk. This suggests that the association is not driven by isolated shifts in autonomic activity, but rather by a consistently impaired autonomic balance in free-living conditions. The effect appears to be driven in part by a failure to show appropriate decreases in heart rate during rest, as individuals with higher hourly heart rates at night had an increased risk of heart failure. We cannot exclude the possibility that autonomic dysfunction represents an elevated demand for compensatory mechanisms as heart failure progresses. Studies have shown that patients with heart failure and lower HRV tend to have a worse prognosis of mortaltity. If low HRV or the presence of CAN were primarily driven by existing cardiac complications, it would suggest that individuals with these conditions exhibit more pronounced sympathetic overactivity as a consequence of heart failure progression, and thus reverse causation. Hence, elevated sympathetic activity during rest may indicate a greater reliance on compensatory mechanisms to maintain cardiac output. More precise measures are needed to assess sympathetic activity as primary driver of heart failure or secondary compensating mechanism of cardiac dysfunction. In addition, it remains unclear to what extent the parasympathetic nervous system can act as a protective mechanisms to counterbalance sympathetic dominance, and whether a decline in the balance of HRV reflects a breakdown. The two pathways, autonomic neuropathy and cardiac remodelling, are not mutually exclusive and may interact in a reinforcing cycle. Autonomic dysfunction can lead to increased sympathetic tone and reduced parasympathetic modulation, placing the heart under chronic stress and promoting structural and functional changes. In turn, cardiac remodeling may impair autonomic regulation, further exacerbating the imbalance. This interplay may create a self-perpetuating loop that accelerates the progression of heart failure. However, this remains beyond the scope of our current data and analysis.

In Study III, we showed presence of CAN was linked with indicators of heart failure by elevated NT-proBNP, higher WATCH-DM risk score and presence of symptoms defined by NYHA. We stratified by the presence of symptoms based on NYHA classification, showing that the association between CAN and elevated NT-proBNP remains. This supports the notion that CAN may help detect asymptomatic cases (ref.). \[Discuss the challenge of assymptomatical HF\]. Studies has shown that CAN is pronogstical linked with incident with heart failure and type 2 diabetes [@kaze2022]. This suggest regardless of the direction between CAN and indication of heart failure, the detection of CAN could be utilize to define individuals with heart failure risk. These individuals could be benefit from further cardiovascular assessment e.g. echocardiography or intervention on to prevent further progression of CAN. Heart failure risk is above 2 times higher people with type 2 diabetes compared to people without diabetes [@kenny2019]. In populations with type 2 diabetes, the risk of heart failure varies considerably, making reliable indicators for risk stratification important. Our findings support the potential of CAN as a useful marker to identify people with type 2 diabetes at higher risk of heart failure. However, further studies including measures from echocardiography are needed to validate this approach. If confirmed, this could open the door for targeted interventions based on risk stratification.

### The utility of long-term HRV and CART in cardiovascular disease \[under construction\]

Previous evidence

When using long-term HRV recordings, careful consideration is needed to determine how best to utilize the data in relation to the specific research objectives.

In diabetes and cardiovascular research, 24-hour HRV measures of indices reflecting heart rate responses to in- and expiration such as RMSSD, HF and pNN50 are more sensitive to behavioral influences and therefore have not consistently shown strong associations with cardiovascular or metabolic outcomes, especially when compared to measures based on total variability [@rinaldi2023][@coopmans2020]. However, when HRV is analyzed in shorter segments (e.g., hourly or in 5-minute intervals), measures like RMSSD, pNN50, and HF appear to offer new insights into autonomic function and its relevance in diabetes and cardiovascular disease, e.g during night-time [@hadad2021][@chellappa2025]. SDANN and SDNNi aim to reduce the impact of short-term variability, such as that caused by physical activity, by calculating either the standard deviation of 5-minute segment mean IBI (SDANN) or the mean of standard deviations across 5-minute segments (SDNNi). \[include lower-frequency points\]. This helps smooth out transient fluctuations and better capture long-term autonomic modulation. Thus, behavioral patterns pose a limitation in physiological research aiming to disentangle the causal pathways between autonomic dysfunction and cardiovascular disease when using long-term HRV measures. These patterns likely introduce high variability between observations that is not attributable to autonomic function itself. However, it simultaneously highlights a potential target for intervention, given that low HRV may be indicative of adverse lifestyle patterns. For instance, behavioral patterns such as disrupted sleep or irregular meal timing may influence circadian fluctuations in HRV. Evidence from studies on night-shift workers suggests that meal timing affects HRV, with daytime meals leading to higher HRV during night hours [@chellappa2025]. Thus, although long-term HRV may lack the precision to disentangle sympathetic and parasympathetic activity due to overlapping behavioral and physiological influences, it may be a valuable tool for assessing autonomic responses in free-living conditions and informing lifestyle-based strategies to improve cardiovascular health. Hence, HRV show potential as a responsive marker to monitor successfullness in CVD risk management.

While GLP-1 receptor agonists are proven to lower cardiovascular risk, they have also been shown to increase heart rate and reduce HRV in short-term trials [@kumarathurai2016]. This may seem conflicting with the hypothesis that reduced HRV reflects higher cardiovascular risk. However, the beneficial effects of GLP-1 agonists on cardiometabolic risk factors, including improved glycaemic control, weight loss, blood pressure reduction, and anti-inflammatory actions, likely outweigh the mild adverse effects on autonomic markers. Thus, the overall cardiovascular benefit is preserved despite small autonomic changes.

#### Risk-stratification

We demonstrated that autonomic dysfunction and CAN are linked to cardiovascular risk and complications. Beyond the question of the etiological explanation lies the question of whether the condition can serve as a risk indicator for CVD/heart failure and therefore be used to identify patients at higher risk and thus improve risk stratification of CVD/heart failure. This perspective can be viewed from two angles: (1) long-term HRV may improve precision in predicting individual CVD risk when added to clinical risk scores, and (2) long-term HRV may help identify preclinical manifestations of cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction, which could be targeted to prevent future CVD. If the added value of long-term HRV would change or improve traditional CVD risk score e.g. SCORE-2 and Framingham [@score2workinggroupandesccardiovascularriskcollaboration2021][@dagostino2008]. However, most biomarkers has shown low incremental value, as sex, age, lipids, diabetes status and blood pressure remains most important. Earlier studies support that 24-hour HRV adds value by improving risk discrimination for cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality in type 2 diabetes[@cardoso2023] and stroke in older adults[@bodapati2017]. However, a limitation of these studies is that the reference model has not been calibrated or validated on a larger scale compared to SCORE2 and Framingham.

Stratifying presence of preclinical manifestation of autonomic dysfunction remains to be understood. These considerations are only relevant if specific interventions demonstrate a mediating effect of targeting autonomic function in preventing CVD outcomes. In other words, interventions aimed at patients with autonomic dysfunction must show greater benefits in preventing CVD compared to those without autonomic dysfunction. Studies have shown that medication and lifestyle interventions can improve HRV in the short term [@chellappa2025][@picard2021]. High-intensity interval training (HIIT) improves autonomic function in obese individuals with and without type 2 diabetes, with HRV benefits seen only in those without diabetes \[\@bönhof2022\], while lifestyle changes in prediabetes enhance short-term HRV, which seems to explain the reduction in diabetes risk independently of weight loss \[\@carnethon2006\]. However, it remains to be proven whether these effects are sustainable in maintaining of autonomic function and secondly is effective in preventing CVD. Particularly for lifestyle improvements and intensified diabetes management, a large proportion of the enhancement in autonomic function may be explained by indirect effects through improvements in cardiometabolic markers such as glucose levels, lipid profile, body weight, VO2max, and blood pressure.

If long-term HRV or CART is to be considered for improving risk stratification, it remains important to determine at what stage in the progression of diabetes risk, autonomic dysfunction becomes meaningful for early detection and intervention. In Study I, we observed that 24-hour HRV was more strongly associated with arterial stiffness in individuals with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes compared to those with normal glucose metabolism. The modifying association of type 2 diabetes between autonomic dysfunction and cardiovascular complications has been demonstrated in multiple cohorts [@agarwalsunilk.2017][@hadad2021]. In Study II, we observed that long-term measures of HRV were strongly associated with cardiovascular risk, with an association equivalent to 4.5 additional years of aging for MACE risk and 2.2 to 2.4 additional years for heart failure per one standard deviation (33 ms) lower in week-long SDNN. Hence, our findings demonstrate that autonomic dysfunction has a strong link with cardiovascular risk in people with prediabetes or those at high risk of developing diabetes, suggesting that autonomic dysfunction is relevant for cardiovascular risk already in the early stages of diabetes progression. In Study III, we demonstrated promising results supporting the potential of using CART-based CAN screening to identify individuals with type 2 diabetes who may be living with asymptomatic heart failure.

A main limitation of our findings in terms of risk stratification is that we did not investigate, in metabolically at-risk populations, whether incorporating measures from long-term HRV or CART as individual risk factors or as components of a risk score improves risk detection by enhancing sensitivity or specificity compared to existing structured guidelines for screening, prevention, and treatment of CVD and heart failure.
