The aim of this thesis is to understand how cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction and CAN affect the risk of cardiovascular disease across stages of glucose metabolism. Given the rising prevalence of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, and their association with increased risks of CVD and heart failure, there is a pressing need for earlier indicators to help healthcare providers intervene in a timely manner and prevent progression to more advanced stages of cardiovascular complications. One promising approach involves leveraging data from wearable devices and standardized screening tools. Heart rate dynamics and variability across different circumstances may hold promise as accessible indicators for early cardiovascular risk stratification.

The following section presents a summary of the main findings from this dissertation, interpreted in the context of existing research in the field, and discusses their clinical relevance across different levels of healthcare. Moreover, the strengths and limitations of the methods and results will be discussed.

## Summary of findings

In this thesis, autonomic dysfunction, defined by long-term HRV and standardized CARTs, and its relationship with cardiovascular complications were studied across three different cohorts representing populations at varying levels of prevention and care, including public health, primary care, and secondary care. In the Maastricht study (Study I), I investigated autonomic dysfunction, measured by 24-hour HRV, and arterial stiffness, assessed dynamically at the aortic site and locally at the carotid site among individuals with normal glucose metabolism, prediabetes, and type 2 diabetes. Lower HRV was associated with higher aortic and carotid stiffness. This association was evident regardless of glucose metabolism status, and was more pronounced in individuals with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes. While no significant difference was observed between prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, the association was modified by HbA1c after excluding individuals with type 2 diabetes, supporting the modifying effect of dysglycemia. Z-scores of time- and frequency-domain measures showed the strongest associations, primarily driven by HRV indices reflecting total variation in interbeat intervals (SDNN, SDANN, SDNN index, ULF, VLF, TP).

Following Study I, I focused on individuals at higher risk of developing diabetes, using data from the ADDITION-PRO (Study II) cohort of individuals representing high-risk individuals of diabetes. In study II, per lower SD in SDNN, measured over a multiple days, was associated with 18%, 24%, and 21% higher risk for ischemic-related CVD, hospitalization of heart failure, and all-cause mortality, respectively. The risk became higher at SDNN levels below 120 ms, supported by a greater difference in incidence rates between individuals with 100 ms and 120 ms than the difference observed between individuals with 120 ms and 160 ms. Hourly measures suggested a specific time point related to ischemic-related cardiovascular disease, as lower SDNN recorded between 6:00 and 7:00 AM was associated with MACE. Residual adjustment of concurrent heart rate and physical movement did not explain the observed association. Hourly SDNN was associated with all-cause MRR, although no specific time point showed an exceptionally strong association. While no association between hourly SDNN and heart failure was observed, higher heart rate during the night hours from 02:00 to 06:00 AM was linked to an increased risk of heart failure hospitalization.

Our findings suggest that both long-term HRV measures and hourly HRV responses may serve as indicators of CVD risk. However, a key limitation is that long-term HRV was assessed under free-living conditions, which restricts the ability to perform standardized tests of autonomic function. In the CANCAN study (study III), I used standardized CARTs to define CAN and describe indicators of heart failure, defined by elevated NT-proBNP, WATCH-DM risk, and NYHA classification among those with and without CAN in a population with type 2 diabetes. In CANCAN, two out five had CAN. Compared to individuals without CAN, theses individual more often showed signs of heart failure, including elevated NT-proBNP levels, higher WATCH-DM risk score, and higher classifications on the NYHA. CAN was association elevated NT-proBNP levels and the persisted even among individuals without heart failure symptoms based on NYHA classification, as well as those categorized as having low to moderate heart failure risk according to the WATCH-DM score.

In summary, various aspects of autonomic dysfunction and cardiovascular complications were investigated in populations with normal glucose metabolism, prediabetes, and type 2 diabetes.The overall findings showed that autonomic function, assessed through long-term HRV and diurnal HRV responses, is associated with an increased risk of CVD. This relationship appears to be stronger in more severe stages of dysglycemia. Moreover, among individuals with type 2 diabetes, the presence of CAN may help identify those at higher risk of heart failure, even in the absence of heart failure symptoms.

## Discussion of results

To address this aim, we used three different cohorts that reflect various levels of prevention and care. In Study I, we approached the question from a public health perspective by using data from The Maastricht Study, including individuals aged 40 and above, representing all stages from normal glucose metabolism to type 2 diabetes. In this broader population, we demonstrated a link between lower 24-hour HRV and cardiovascular risk, measured by arterial stiffness. This association was modified by glucose metabolism, showing a stronger relationship in individuals with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. This led to a focus on individuals at higher risk of developing diabetes, using data from the ADDITION-PRO cohort. Individuals with prediabetes may benefit from structured guidance in primary care to prevent progression to type 2 diabetes and related complications such as cardiovascular disease. In Study II, we showed that in a population with prediabetes, lower multiday HRV was associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and all-cause mortality. In Study III, we showed that among individuals with type 2 diabetes, those with CAN had a higher risk of heart failure, measured by elevated NT-proBNP levels, and this association remained significant in subgroups without heart failure symptoms or with a low-to-moderate heart failure risk score.

Cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction, indicated by lower HRV or abnormal values in CARTs, is associated with increased cardiovascular risk across all stages of glucose metabolism. In the next section, we will discuss potential mechanisms and explore the clinical utility of HRV and CARTs at different stages of diabetes risk. Cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction and its impact on heart disease across glucose metabolism This thesis shows that cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction, measured by HRV and CARTs, is associated with cardiovascular disease risk across the spectrum of glucose metabolism dysregulation. This association is evident with measures of arteriosclerosis, atherosclerotic events, all-cause mortality, and heart failure in individuals at high risk of diabetes, as well as with indications of heart failure in patients with type 2 diabetes.

## Cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction and its impact on heart disease across glucose metabolism

This thesis shows that cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction, measured by HRV and CARTs, is associated with cardiovascular disease risk across the spectrum of glucose metabolism dysregulation. This association is evident with measures of arteriosclerosis, atherosclerotic events, all-cause mortality, and heart failure in individuals at high risk of diabetes, as well as with indications of heart failure in patients with type 2 diabetes.

#### Arteriosclerosis

In Study I, I demonstrated that autonomic dysfunction, as measured by 24-hour HRV, is associated with arterial stiffness, assessed both dynamically (cf-PWV) and locally (CD). This suggests that autonomic responses under free-living conditions contribute to the development of arterial stiffness.

Arterial stiffness is not only a structural marker of vascular ageing but is also dynamically modulated by local endothelial signals and autonomic nervous system activity. Several studies have demonstrated a link between elevated sympathetic tone and increased arterial stiffness[@casey2011][@nardone2020]. Two possible mechanisms may explain how autonomic nervous function is related to arterial stiffness. First, autonomic dysfunction may increase the vascular tone of large arteries, thereby impairing arterial elasticity. Animal studies support this notion. In rats, proper autonomic regulation has been shown to be essential for maintaining aortic elasticity, and heightened sympathetic activity has been shown to damage elastin fibres, resulting in stiffer arteries. While such findings cannot be directly extrapolated to humans, they suggest plausible biological pathways. Second, the autonomic nervous system regulates heart rate and cardiac contractility. Autonomic dysfunction typically manifests as both reduced HRV and elevated resting heart rate. Arterial shear stress increases as a result of heightened sympathetic activity and parasympathetic withdrawal. A higher resting heart rate may contribute to arterial stiffness by altering blood flow dynamics and increasing shear stress. Our earlier study using data from the Whitehall II cohort showed that a steeper decrease in short-term (5-minute) HRV over a ten-year period was linked with higher levels of aortic stiffness in the subsequent five years [@schaarup2023].

Previous studies have shown an association between autonomic dysfunction, as measured by short-term HRV during rest, and arterial stiffness[@angelaberos2023]. Our data from Study I extended this perspective by using long-term HRV. Its association with arterial stiffness was modified by dysglycemia, suggesting that autonomic dysfunction may lie on the pathway from dysglycemia to the development of arterial stiffness, even before the onset of type 2 diabetes. Data from the Whitehall II study showed that aortic stiffness increased more steeply with higher HbA1c values among non-diabetic individuals[@mceniery2017]. In the subpopulation in Study I without diabetes, I observed modification by HbA1c in both aortic and carotid stiffness. The modifying effect of HbA1c suggests an amplified impact of hyperglycemia on the consequences of autonomic dysfunction. In our analysis, several time-domain and frequency-domain HRV measures based on the total variability were modified by diabetes status, whereas the association with mean interbeat interval remained unchanged. This suggests that lower HRV may indicate a different risk profile for arterial stiffness, compared to heart rate alone.

#### Atherosclerosis

In Study II, I showed that individuals with a preclinical stage of autonomic dysfunction, measured by multiday HRV, face a higher risk of incident ischemic cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and all-cause mortality.

Multiple mechanisms may explain how autonomic dysfunction contributes to the initiation and progression of ischemic events and stroke. First, as discussed in Study I, autonomic dysfunction may promote arteriosclerosis, leading to arterial stiffness. This stiffness impairs vasodilation and may enhance vasoconstriction, increasing hemodynamic stress and the risk of plaque rupture and thrombus formation [@bentzon2014]. In this context, findings from Study I may not entirely distinguish between arterial stiffness and atherosclerosis, as shown by data from the Rotterdam Study[@vanpopele2001]. As plaques develop, the associated increase in sympathetic nerve density around the arteries could reduce arterial elasticity. In a smaller study of people with type 2 diabetes, lower HRV was linked with increased carotid atherosclerosis [@gottsäter2006].

Second, the autonomic nervous system innervates the adventitia layer of blood vessels, where it modulates vascular tone via sympathetic fibres. Although atherosclerotic plaques form in the intima layer, recent in vivo studies have demonstrated that increased plaque burden is associated with higher local sympathetic nerve density, likely mediated by neuroinflammatory processes. Notably, reducing sympathetic innervation has been shown to attenuate plaque formation in animal models[@mohanta2022]. These findings suggest that autonomic dysfunction may not only reflect but also actively contribute to atherogenesis.

Third, autonomic nervous dysfunction has been shown to interfere with signalling pathways controlling heart rhythm, potentially leading to arrhythmias that disturb cardiac contraction. Data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study illustrated that lower short-term HRV was associated with incident atrial fibrillation over 20 years, with a higher risk among participants with type 2 diabetes[@agarwalsunilk.2017]. This supports the role of autonomic dysfunction in arrhythmogenesis, which increases the risk of myocardial infarction and stroke. However, in Study II, I did not include incident atrial fibrillation as an outcome. Future research is needed to explore whether it could explain the higher risk of major adverse cardiovascular events.

A study of individuals with coronary artery disease showed that stress-induced HRV was associated with myocardial infarction, even more than resting HRV, suggesting that reduced parasympathetic modulation of heart rate under stress may play a role in ischemia [@osei2024]. Our study focused on long-term HRV under free-living conditions, capturing stress-responsive periods such as morning awakening. These recordings likely reflect underlying autonomic dynamics relevant to cardiovascular risk. A Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) in the UK biobank of short-term HRV support this by identifying mechanisms involving G-protein signaling, pacemaker activity, and mitochondrial function. These pathways influence vagal control, cardiac excitability, and energy metabolism[@nolte2017]. Although derived from short-term recordings, the genetic associations may reflect autonomic traits that persist across different time scales, thereby reinforcing the biological basis of HRV. A Mendelian randomization study using data from the Rotterdam Study found that genetically predicted HRV was associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation[@geurts2023]. However, this association did not extend to all-cause mortality or cardiovascular death in the UK Biobank cohort, where only phenotypically measured HRV showed a significant relationship with these outcomes[@tegegne2023]. Interestingly, the genetic determinants of HRV exhibited pleiotropic relationships with several autonomic traits, including resting heart rate, heart rate response during exercise, and post-exercise recovery dynamics[@tegegne2023]. No genome-wide association study (GWAS) has been conducted for long-term HRV.

#### Heart failure

The relationship between cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction and heart failure is complex [@shen2014]. On one hand, autonomic dysfunction may represent a complication that contributes to cardiac stress, sympathetic overactivation, and eventual heart failure. On the other hand, it may reflect the progression of cardiac remodelling and declining cardiac output. Our findings demonstrated a relationship between autonomic dysfunction and heart failure both cross-sectionally in a population with type 2 diabetes and prospectively in individuals representing different tiers of diabetes risk. However, our data are limited in determining the extent to which this relationship supports one explanation over the other, as we lack baseline and follow-up measures of both heart failure and HRV.

Findings from Study I confirmed the relationship between autonomic dysfunction and arterial stiffness. It is well established that arterial stiffness is linked to cardiac remodelling, as increased cf-PWV leads to an earlier return of the reflected pulse wave to the aorta, which increases cardiac afterload and reduces coronary perfusion pressure [@boutouyrie2021]. Therefore, autonomic dysfunction may have an indirect effect on heart failure, potentially mediated by arterial stiffness. However, structured analyses are needed to confirm these pathways. For example, through mediation analysis to assess the direct and indirect effects of arterial stiffness, with autonomic dysfunction as the main determinant. In Study II, I observed that multiday HRV was associated with incident heart failure, and approximately one-fourth of the risk was explained by resting heart rate. Data from the Rotterdam Study showed that short-term HRV was longitudinally associated with echocardiographic measures reflecting systolic function, suggesting that autonomic dysfunction contributes to cardiac remodelling [@arshi2022]. In contrast to MACE outcomes, findings from Study II showed no specific time point in hourly HRV that was associated with heart failure. Instead, it was the overall daily pattern captured by multiday HRV that was linked to heart failure risk. This suggests that the association is not driven by isolated shifts in autonomic activity, but rather by a consistently impaired autonomic balance under free-living conditions. The effect appears to be driven in part by a failure to show appropriate decreases in heart rate during rest, as individuals with higher hourly heart rates at night had an increased risk of heart failure. In Study III, I observed that individuals with CAN had higher risk of elevated levels of NT-proBNP, a biomarker of myocardial stress and early heart failure. Therefore, CAN is associated with hemodynamic consequences that contribute to both structural and functional cardiac remodeling, which in turn leads to elevated NT-proBNP levels.

We cannot exclude the possibility that autonomic dysfunction represents an elevated demand for compensatory mechanisms as heart failure progresses. Studies have shown that patients with heart failure and lower HRV tend to have a worse prognosis in terms of mortality. If low HRV or the presence of CAN were primarily driven by existing cardiac complications, it would suggest that individuals with these conditions exhibit more pronounced sympathetic overactivity as a consequence of heart failure progression, indicating potential reverse causation. Hence, elevated sympathetic activity during rest may reflect a greater reliance on compensatory mechanisms to maintain cardiac output. More precise measures are needed to assess whether sympathetic activity acts as a primary driver of heart failure or as a secondary compensatory response to cardiac dysfunction. In addition, it remains unclear to what extent the parasympathetic nervous system can act as a protective mechanism to counterbalance sympathetic dominance, and whether a decline in HRV reflects a breakdown of this balance. The two pathways (autonomic neuropathy and cardiac remodelling) are not mutually exclusive and may interact in a reinforcing cycle. Autonomic dysfunction can lead to increased sympathetic tone and reduced parasympathetic modulation, placing the heart under chronic stress and promoting structural and functional changes[@ritchie2020]. In turn, cardiac remodelling may impair autonomic regulation, further exacerbating the imbalance. This interplay may create a self-perpetuating loop that accelerates the progression of heart failure. However, this remains beyond the scope of our current data and analysis.

### Clinical implications

No specific role has yet been defined for autonomic dysfunction in clinical decision-making within healthcare, as current treatment and intervention options remain limited. Despite the fact that our results do not extend to the implementation of autonomic dysfunction in clinical practice, the use of diverse cohorts representing public health, primary care, and secondary care marks a notable first step in addressing autonomic dysfunctions impact on cardiovascular complication. I will now turn to the clinical implications of using autonomic dysfunction in the prevention of CVD. If long-term HRV or CARTs are to be considered for improving risk stratification, it is important to determine at what stage in the progression of diabetes risk, and at which level of care, autonomic dysfunction becomes meaningful for early detection and intervention.

#### Public health

A key preventive strategy for cardiovascular disease is the identification and treatment of high-risk individuals[@rose2008]. Public health approaches complement this by promoting healthy lifestyles, ensuring early screening for risk factors, and improving access to essential care and medications.

Studies I and II demonstrated a strong association between long-term HRV and cardiovascular disease risk, with particularly pronounced associations in individuals with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. These findings suggest that HRV metrics could serve as early indicators for stratifying individuals who may benefit from preventive interventions. The longitudinal relationship, based on repeated measures of HRV and cf-PWV, demonstrates that changes in HRV are associated with alterations in aortic stiffness [@schaarup2023]. Thus, a declining HRV trend detected by smartwatches may help identify individuals who require more intensive interventions.

I examined a general population across the full spectrum of glucose metabolism. Our findings revealed that low long-term HRV, is consistently associated with arterial stiffness, regardless of glycemic status. In Study I, one standard deviation lower HRV was equivalent to the effect of 2.7 additional years on cf-PWV and 1.6 years on CD [@schaarup2024]. In Study II, long-term measures of HRV were strongly associated with cardiovascular risk, with an effect size equivalent to 4.5 additional years of aging for major adverse cardiovascular events and 2.2 to 2.4 years for heart failure per one standard deviation (33 ms) lower in multiday SDNN intervals [@schaarup2024b]. Autonomic dysfunction is known to precede the development of hypertension[@schroeder2003][@mancia2014], which is an early and major risk factor for subsequent cardiovascular disease. Our results support the role of HRV as an early marker of cardiovascular health, both in the general population and among those with elevated cardiometabolic risk. As such, our studies suggest that monitoring cardiovascular risk progression or remission through long-term HRV may be valuable.

A limitation of implementing HRV monitoring, especially for long-term recordings, has been the demanding equipment requirements, such as the need for ECG recorders like Holter monitors. In recent years, wearable devices have become increasingly popular among the general public [@dhingra2023]. These devices offer an easy, non-invasive way to collect heart rate and HRV data and to monitor their progression over time. Further challenges include ensuring accurate measurement of interbeat intervals and determining which HRV indices are most suitable as markers of cardiovascular health. In diabetes and cardiovascular research, 24-hour HRV indices that reflect heart rate responses to inspiration and expiration (such as RMSSD, HF, and pNN50) are more sensitive to behavioral influences and therefore have not consistently shown strong associations with cardiovascular or metabolic outcomes, compared to measures based on total variability (SDNN, SDANN, TP, ULF, VLF, LF) [@rinaldi2023][@coopmans2020][@schaarup2024]. However, the utility of these respiration-related indices appears to improve when measured during rest in shorter segments, such as 5-minute recordings(ref.).

If HRV monitoring proves effective by helping individuals maintain a healthy, age-adjusted HRV range through lifestyle changes, and by prompting healthcare engagement in response to sustained deterioration of HRV, then HRV could become a meaningful marker for long-term health monitoring. A cross-sectional study involving 8 million individuals with HRV data from wearable devices found that those who took more steps per day exhibited higher HRV[@natarajan2020]. A key public health challenge in integrating wearable devices into healthcare is ensuring equitable access, as individuals from lower socioeconomic groups are significantly less likely to own or use such devices. This raises the risk of health disparities by overlooking high-risk populations with lower income or education levels. Despite these concerns, there is encouraging evidence that the general population is open to digital health innovations. Studies have shown that most individuals are willing to share their health data with public health institutions and to allow algorithm-based systems, such as artificial intelligence, to collaborate with healthcare professionals in monitoring disease [@dhingra2023][@schaarup2023a]. Therefore, monitoring HRV through wearable devices may serve as a first step in tracking health status and facilitating timely referrals to primary care when risk levels increase.

#### Primary care

Cardiovascular risk in primary care is assessed using clinical evaluations and standardized risk prediction tools to identify individuals at elevated risk (ref.). Management focuses on lifestyle modification, pharmacological therapy, and regular monitoring to reduce cardiovascular events (ref.). As the clinical paradigm shifts from a focus on ischemia toward more preventive strategies targeting atherogenesis, greater attention is being paid to individual risk factors that predispose patients to plaque formation [@zaman]. Individuals with prediabetes live with elevated cardiometabolic risk, particularly for ischemic CVD and heart failure [@cai2021a]. Early detection are important as CVD and heart failure leads to lower life-expectancy and quality of life.

In Denmark, prediabetes is defined by impaired glucose regulation and is present in 7.1 percent of adults. One in five of these individuals develops type 2 diabetes within the next 5-years, while others either remain in the prediabetic stage or return to normal glucose levels. Despite their increased risk, they often fall outside structured assessment pathways in primary care, highlighting a critical gap in preventive strategies. This underscores the need for early and precise risk assessment [@birkenfeld2024]. In this section, I evaluate the integration of autonomic function assessment into routine cardiovascular risk stratification, with a particular emphasis on individuals with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes.

A central question is whether autonomic dysfunction can serve not only as a marker of underlying pathophysiology but also as a clinically useful risk indicator for cardiovascular disease and heart failure. If so, it could help identify patients at higher risk and thereby improve risk stratification. This concept can be explored from two complementary perspectives. First, long-term measurements of HRV may enhance the precision of individual cardiovascular risk prediction when added to established clinical risk scores. Second, these measurements may help identify preclinical manifestations of cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction, enabling targeted interventions in a subgroup of patients to prevent future cardiovascular disease.

This raises the question of whether incorporating long-term HRV into traditional cardiovascular risk models, such as the Systematic COronary Risk Evaluation 2 (SCORE2) and the Framingham Risk Score, adds predictive value [@score2workinggroupandesccardiovascularriskcollaboration2021; @dagostino2008]. Our findings in Study I support a potential added value of 24-hour HRV to arterial stiffness, which is considered a surrogate marker of cardiovascular disease risk. In Study II, I extended this perspective by demonstrating a link between multiday HRV and hard endpoints of cardiovascular disease and heart failure. However, our findings are based on associations and do not include outcome prediction [@varga2020]. Therefore, a limitation of our study is that I did not evaluate whether incorporating long-term HRV or CARTs into established risk scores improves detection compared to existing guidelines for cardiovascular disease and heart failure. While most biomarkers have shown limited incremental value beyond established predictors such as age, sex, lipid levels, diabetes status, and blood pressure, some studies suggest that 24-hour HRV may improve risk discrimination for CVD and all-cause mortality in individuals with type 2 diabetes [@cardoso2023], and for stroke in older adults [@bodapati2017]. However, a key limitation of these studies is that their reference models have not been calibrated or validated in large-scale cohorts or in combination with established risk scores such as SCORE2 and the Framingham Risk Score.

The increasing availability of wearable devices capable of capturing long-term HRV data presents a practical opportunity for continuous monitoring in primary care settings. These devices may facilitate earlier detection of autonomic dysfunction and support more personalized approaches to the prevention and management of cardiovascular risk. However, the clinical utility of stratifying patients based on preclinical autonomic dysfunction remains uncertain. These considerations are only actionable if interventions targeting autonomic function can be shown to reduce cardiovascular risk. Emerging evidence suggests that both pharmacological and lifestyle interventions can improve HRV in the short term [@chellappa2025; @picard2021]. For example, high-intensity interval training has been shown to improve autonomic function in obese individuals with and without type 2 diabetes, although benefits in HRV were observed only in those without diabetes[@bönhof2022]. Similarly, lifestyle changes in individuals with prediabetes have been associated with improvements in short-term HRV, which may partly explain the reduction in diabetes risk independently of weight loss [@carnethon2006].

Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether these effects are sustainable over time and whether they translate into long-term cardiovascular protection. Particularly in the context of lifestyle improvements and intensified diabetes management, much of the observed enhancement in autonomic function may be mediated indirectly through improvements in cardiometabolic markers such as glucose levels, lipid profiles, body weight, maximal oxygen uptake, and blood pressure. Despite current uncertainties, monitoring autonomic function through long-term HRV may offer a valuable tool for assessing cardiovascular risk and tracking the impact of preventive strategies. However, its clinical utility must be confirmed through robust evidence demonstrating sustained effects and improved cardiovascular outcomes.

#### Secondary care

In secondary care, endocrinologists assess cardiovascular and heart failure risk by integrating advanced diagnostics, biomarker analysis, and imaging to detect early dysfunction. The treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes is guided by evidence-based therapies and multidisciplinary collaboration. The ADA/EASD 2022 consensus on Management of Hyperglycemia in Type 2 Diabetes emphasizes that early detection of heart failure in individuals with type 2 diabetes is crucial, as it enables timely initiation of therapies such as SGLT2 inhibitors, which have demonstrated significant benefits in reducing heart failure-related outcomes [@davies2022]. A major challenge in diabetes care is detecting heart failure before symptoms appear, as patients with symptomatic heart failure face a higher risk of mortality and more frequent hospitalizations @pop-busui2022\]. The AHA, ACC, and HFSA 2022 guidelines recommend identifying individuals at risk of heart failure based on factors such as diabetes, poor glycaemic control, uncontrolled hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, elevated BMI, albuminuria, renal dysfunction, and a history of CVD [@heidenreich2022]. Still, there is a need to identify optimal approaches for recognizing and diagnosing heart failure in clinical care, as broad echocardiographic screening in type 2 diabetes is time-consuming and costly [@pop-busui2022].

I demonstrated that CAN may help identify individuals at increased risk of heart failure, beyond what is captured by symptoms or existing risk scores. Our findings support considering CAN as a relevant risk factor for heart failure and suggest it may have value in future risk stratification strategies in type 2 diabetes. A clinical advantage of using CARTs is that they are standardized tests performed under controlled conditions. As discussed, these tests are reliable and reproducible, with reference values established in large population studies [@hansen2025]. Beyond our findings and the established evidence of increased heart failure risk, CAN in the type 2 diabetes population also identifies individuals at high risk for cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, and early mortality. In Study III, I observed that two out of five participants had CAN, highlighting it as a prevalent complication. Therefore, detecting CAN may uncover an often-overlooked condition that is common in individuals with type 2 diabetes.

Clinical stratification of care includes two key considerations: (1) CAN should be further evaluated for associated cardiovascular complications, such as heart failure; and (2) cardiopreventive strategies should be initiated earlier in this subgroup.

First, patients with CAN may benefit from further cardiovascular assessment, including the use of sensitive biomarkers or echocardiography. NT-proBNP is a strong predictor of heart failure and a validated biomarker for ruling out the condition (ref.). However, its specificity varies across heart failure phenotypes, being less specific for detecting HFpEF compared to HFrEF. Therefore, additional evaluation using echocardiography is warranted. Echocardiography not only helps classify heart failure phenotypes but also identifies preclinical stages of heart failure through the detection of functional or structural cardiac abnormalities. An important question remains: to what extent does CAN overlap with cardiac abnormalities identified via echocardiography? Including CAN in structured assessments of heart failure could help clarify this relationship. Determining the diagnostic and prognostic value of CAN, particularly its sensitivity and specificity in detecting HFrEF and HFpEF, requires further investigation.

Second, the presence of CAN may justify earlier initiation of protective therapies. SGLT2 inhibitors are recommended as second-line treatment in type 2 diabetes and have demonstrated benefits in reducing the risk of heart failure, cardiovascular disease, and kidney function decline, complications commonly associated with CAN. Current guidelines recommend initiating these therapies based on a history of cardiovascular disease, heart failure, or the presence of conventional high-risk cardiovascular factors. However, the specific impact of SGLT2 inhibitors on the progression of cardiorenal outcomes in patients with CAN remains to be fully understood. Furthermore, while antihypertensive treatment is a cornerstone of cardiovascular risk management, whether specific classes of antihypertensive agents offer protective effects in patients with CAN remains to be explored.

The clinical implications of our findings in Study III are limited. Tthe generalizability of our results is restricted, as our study population consisted of patients with type 2 diabetes receiving secondary care. I observed that two out of five patients with CAN also had a history of cardiovascular disease—a group already at increased risk of heart failure due to their prior diagnosis. This overlap may influence the interpretation of CAN as an independent risk factor. Therefore, our findings need to be validated in a broader population with type 2 diabetes, including individuals without a history of cardiovascular disease. Doing so would allow for greater generalizability of our results to the broader type 2 diabetes population, particularly those in primary care.

## Strengths and limitations

### Study design

*Cross-sectional design*

Studies I and III are based on cross-sectional data, with exposure and outcome measured within a three-month period. The main limitation of this design is that it does not allow us to determine whether the exposure led to the outcome or vice versa. As a result, we cannot establish temporality or confirm whether changes in the outcome were caused by the exposure. However, based on prior evidence, I assume the direction of the associations using physiological knowledge and in vivo studies. In Study I, we based our direction of the association on longitudinal associations observed in the Whitehall II study, showing steeper decrease in short-term HRV are associated with subsequent higher levels of cf-PWV [@schaarup2023]. Moreover, \[insert in vivo studies\].

In Study I, I attempted to mimic temporality by stratifying individuals with and without known type 2 diabetes, showing that deterioration in glucose metabolism increased the strength of the association.

In Study III, the design focused more on the clinical diagnosis of CAN and the presence of heart failure. The research question was oriented toward the clinical utility of CAN in identifying patients with type 2 diabetes who may be progressing early toward heart failure. Thus, the aetiological question remains better suited for other study designs. Whether cardiac function progressively worsens due to the underlying mechanisms of CAN remains to be fully established. If confirmed, this would highlight the relevance of CAN as a preclinical marker for early progression to heart failure, potentially serving as a target for preventive strategies.

*Longitudinal design*

A major strength of Study II is its longitudinal design, where HRV was measured at baseline and outcomes were captured prospectively through national registries. This temporal structure ensures that the exposure (HRV) preceded the outcome, reducing the risk of reverse causation. The prospective design allows for stronger inference of directionality than cross-sectional studies. Furthermore, the use of high-quality registry data ensures complete outcome ascertainment and minimizes loss to follow-up bias. Study II relied on a single assessment of HRV at baseline. Future studies with repeated HRV measurements over time would provide deeper insights into autonomic function dynamics on CVD risk.

Based on our studies, I demonstrate initial steps in understanding the relationship between cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction, measured by HRV or CART, and cardiovascular complications. However, I can only establish associations and cannot conclude with certainty that improvements in HRV lead to reduced cardiovascular risk. Therefore, causal inference cannot be drawn from our findings, and more causally focused methods are needed. Mendelian randomization, which uses genetic instruments for exposure, could help address this question. Additionally, structured mediation analysis involving modifications such as medication or lifestyle changes could clarify whether improving HRV or CART reduces cardiovascular risk, using data from intervention studies.

### Internal validity

In this project, I aimed to assess cardiovascular autonomic function both in free-living conditions and in response to standardized test procedures during clinical visits. Additionally, I used dynamic measurements to evaluate arterial stiffness both locally and by velocity, and biomarker assessments to determine the presence of heart failure. In this section, I discuss the validity of 24-hour, multiday, and hourly HRV measurements, as well as the standardized tests of CAN. I also address the validity of the included outcomes and discuss the strengths and limitations of using MACE as a time-to-event outcome.

#### Long-term HRV (\>24 hours) as measurement for autonomic function

A main consideration in HRV analysis is the reliability of raw inter-beat interval data from ECG recordings. To ensure accurate various HRV measures, the intervals must be captured in a continuous and correctly sequenced manner. Frequency-domain analyses depend on the integrity of the inter-beat interval sequence, while some time-domain measures, such as RMSSD and pNN50, specifically quantify the variability in the differences between successive intervals.

In Study I, I used data from a 12-lead Holter system, which is considered the gold standard for long-term ECG recordings. With detailed and sequential inter-beat intervals, I was able to assess the full range of HRV metrics including, time-domain measures of variability between successive intervals, while frequency-domain measures were derived across power bands from high to ultra-low frequencies.

In Study II, I used the Actiheart device to assess HRV. The device was configured to record continuously over an 8-day period. It captured 30-second epochs of mean heart rate intervals, along with upper and lower prediction intervals. From each epoch, I generated a distribution of inter-beat intervals. An algorithm was applied to estimate HRV from these distributions, and its validation showed strong agreement with established metrics, including SDNN, SDANN, and the SDNN index [@taskforceoftheeuropeansocietyofcardiologythenorthamericansocietyofpacingelectrophysiology1996][@schaarup2024a]. However, a limitation of this dataset is that it did not allow for the calculation of frequency-domain measures or specific time-domain metrics such as RMSSD or pNN50. High-frequency power, RMSSD, and pNN50 typically show earlier diurnal peaks compared to low-frequency power and SDNN[@natarajan2020]. These measures are more reflective of parasympathetic activity during in- and expiration. It remains to be determined how these hourly measures relate to cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and all-cause mortality.

In the context of this study, which focuses on long-term HRV in free-living conditions, it is important to acknowledge that the autonomic nervous function we aim to assess may also be influenced by behavioral factors such as physical activity, sleep, meal timing, emotions, smoking, caffeine intake, alcohol consumption, medication use, and prior cardiovascular complications. These factors can potentially mask or mimic underlying physiological dysfunction during recordings, but they can also elicit the HRV responses we are interested in. Therefore, reduced long-term HRV cannot be interpreted solely as a marker of autonomic function. HRV is also influenced by lifestyle patterns over time, making it sensitive not only to day-to-day behaviors but also to long-term habits that affect autonomic balance.

In Studies I and II, I accounted for habitual physical activity, and in Study II, I also adjusted hourly HRV for physical movement during recordings to test the influence of concurrent activity. However, further studies are needed to understand how lifestyle patterns affect long-term HRV recordings on subsequent days, in order to separate direct behavioural from physiological components. In both studies, I excluded participants with prior CVD to preserve the etiological order between autonomic dysfunction and cardiovascular outcomes.

Anti-hypertensive medications, especially beta-blockers, are known to increase HRV in randomized controlled trials [@niemelä1994]. However, in cohort studies, participants using anti-hypertensives generally show lower HRV, likely reflecting a higher burden of cardiovascular complications \[ref\]. Because beta-blockers target the autonomic nervous system, they may introduce bias in HRV measurements by interfering with the function I aim to assess. In sensitivity analyses in Studies I and III, excluding participants on anti-hypertensive treatment did not materially change the estimates. Therefore, I included these participants and adjusted for medication use in the full models.

HRV levels are influenced by heart rate, as lower resting heart rate allows for greater variability. In Study I, I chose not to adjust for heart rate in our models, as this could introduce multicollinearity. Additionally, elevated heart rate is driven by increased sympathetic activity and may act as a mediator in the pathway leading to arterial stiffness. Our use of full-day recordings captures HRV during both rest and activity, providing a robust representation of autonomic function over a typical day. In contrast, heart rate correction may be more relevant for short-term HRV recordings, where standardized conditions can be affected by random influences such as time of day, smoking, or caffeine intake. These factors would have been relevant in Study III had I included HRV measures. In Study II, I usesd the residuals method to pre-adjust HRV measures for resting heart rate, which accounted for part of the observed associations, particularly with heart failure and all-cause mortality, and to a lesser extent with ischemic-related CVD events.Similar trends were observed for hourly associations, where heart rate pre-adjustment had had comparable effects on the outcomes.

\[When HRV is analyzed in shorter segments (e.g., hourly or in 5-minute intervals), measures like RMSSD, pNN50, and HF appear to offer new insights into autonomic function and its relevance in diabetes and CVD, e.g during night-time [@hadad2021][@chellappa2025]. SDANN and SDNNi aim to reduce the impact of short-term variability, such as that caused by physical activity, by calculating either the standard deviation of 5-minute segment mean IBI (SDANN) or the mean of standard deviations across 5-minute segments (SDNNi). \[include lower-frequency points\]. This helps smooth out transient fluctuations and better capture long-term autonomic modulation. Thus, behavioral patterns pose a limitation in physiological research aiming to disentangle the causal pathways between autonomic dysfunction and CVD when using long-term HRV measures. These patterns likely introduce high variability between observations that is not attributable to autonomic function itself.\]

#### Cardiovascular autonomic reflex test

CART provides a practical approach for screening for autonomic dysfunction and has been shown to be a reliable method [@fleischer2011]. Although certain indices from CARTs may be influenced by factors such as time of day or recent physical activity, these effects are generally minimal. Furthermore, no impact of caffeine intake has been observed on the reference age-based formula [@hansen2025]. A limitation of the CARTs in this study was the high prevalence of participants who were unable to complete the full battery of tests, primarily due to missing data from the Valsalva manoeuvre.

#### Measures of cardiovascular risk

\[ Arterial stiffness - NT-proBNP - MACE limitation in aetiological research - Non-specific heart failure and MI and stroke and death - HRV stronger link with MI or stroke - Perspective: decreasing number of events with prolonging time-to-event - Clinical trail moved to high risk population in lower-income countries (South America) - Challenge for coming observational cohorts (need to increase sample size) \[The Problem With Composite End Points in Cardiovascular Studies The Story of Major Adverse Cardiac Events and Percutaneous Coronary Intervention\]\]

### External validity

#### Selection bias

**The Maastricht Study**

In Study I, participants were recruited using multiple strategies, with a focus on enrolling individuals with type 2 diabetes to ensure sufficient statistical power. Recruitment was conducted through mass media campaigns, municipal registries, and the regional Diabetes Patient Registry via mailings. Participation therefore depended on individuals’ awareness of the campaigns and their willingness to attend. Patients with type 2 diabetes were actively targeted with additional mail invitations to encourage participation. A strength of Study I sample strategy is representaion of different stages of glucose metabolism.

**ADDITION-PRO**

In Study II, participants were recruited through a stepwise screening procedure. Initially, individuals were selected based on a risk score derived from a self-administered questionnaire sent by mail, followed by HbA1c or random glucose measurements. This process introduced several opportunities for selection bias, as individuals had to receive and return the questionnaire and attend a follow-up visit for blood testing if their risk score was high [@christensen2004].

First, the population consisted of those who responded to the screening questionnaire and those at higher risk who underwent further testing. Second, the questionnaire selected participants based on a risk score designed to identify individuals with type 2 diabetes, while prediabetes was identified through subsequent HbA1c measurements. Risk factors such as age and hypertension contributed to higher scores, potentially leading to overrepresentation of these groups.

Thus, selection bias may arise from both participation in the risk assessment and follow-up attendance in ADDITION, as well as from the instruments used to identify risk, namely, the Inter99 risk score, HbA1c, and random glucose measurements. Healthier individuals are generally more likely to participate in screening and cohort studies \[ref.\].

**CANCAN**

In Denmark, patients with type 2 diabetes are referred to diabetes specialists at outpatient clinics when their general practitioner is unable to stabilize their care. As a result, CANCAN participants represent a higher-risk group among Danish diabetes patients, while more stable patients remain under general practitioner care. Consequently, the prevalence of heart failure indicators and CAN is likely higher in this selected group. A strength of the CANCAN sampling strategy is that patients were already attending endocrinology consultations, and the study examination required only additional time during their visit, without extra transport or appointments.

cross this project, selection bias spans different aspects. In Studies I and II, healthier and more health-conscious individuals were more likely to participate, potentially introducing bias. In contrast, participation in Study III was optimized by aligning study assessments with routine consultations. In epidemiology, I aim to match the source population with the target population, but self-selection in participation can limit this. As a result, participants may be healthier and more engaged with healthcare services, reducing contrast between determinants and outcomes in etiological analyses. One possible explanation for the lack of a stepwise increase in the association between HRV and arterial stiffness across prediabetes and type 2 diabetes in Study I is that participants with type 2 diabetes represented a well-treated population. Although the sample may be sufficient to demonstrate a relationship, the magnitude of the association in this group may be limited.

#### Generalisability

The generalisability of our findings can be considered on two levels: how well the results apply to the general population within the country, and how they translate to populations with different ancestries in other countries.

Studies II and III include individuals at high risk of diabetes and those with type 2 diabetes. Therefore, the associations between cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction and cardiovascular outcomes or surrogate biomarkers are relevant to individuals with some degree of diabetes risk. However, whether these associations hold in the general population remains uncertain. Study I suggests that the link between autonomic dysfunction and cardiovascular risk, as measured by arterial stiffness, is also present in individuals with normal glucose metabolism, though to a lesser extent. This finding was supported by replication in the Whitehall II cohort, strengthening the generalisability of the observed relationship[@schaarup2023].

The study populations in Studies II and III consist of individuals of Nordic descent, while Study I includes individuals of Western European descent. Since the constellation of diabetes risk factors may differ in populations of Asian, South American, African, and other ancestries, our findings may not be fully generalisable to these groups. This limitation affects the applicability and magnitude of the observed associations to an unknown degree. Further cohort studies including underrepresented populations are warranted. As our studies focus on diabetes risk, all participants were adults aged 40 years and older. Therefore, our findings are limited to this age group, and whether the results extend to younger adults or children remains to be confirmed. Overall, while our study benefits from including individuals across different levels of diabetes risk, limitations in generalisability remain, particularly for more diverse and younger populations.
