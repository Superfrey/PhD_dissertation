# Introduction

Diabetes mellitus is a growing global health concern, posing pressing challenges for public health systems[@diabetes2025]. As prevalence rises, more individuals are exposed to an increased risk of premature mortality and cardiovascular disease (CVD)[@diabetes2025]. People live longer lives with diabetes they face longer periods under the burden of diabetes complications[@magliano2022]. Despite advancements in cardiovascular care, many complications are still detected at more advanced stages. These include coronary artery disease, often identified through ischemia or major CVD events and symptomatic heart failure. Early detection of CVD risk and asymptomatic heart failure, such as increased atheroma burden or subclinical heart failure, is desirable[@zamana][@pop-busui2022].

Over the last decades, cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction has repeatedly gained attention as a risk factor for CVD[@hillebrand2013]. Heart rate variability (HRV) is considered a reliable marker for measuring autonomic function, as it reflects the balance between sympathetic and parasympathetic modulation of heart rate intervals[@taskforceoftheeuropeansocietyofcardiologythenorthamericansocietyofpacingelectrophysiology1996]. Despite its recognition as a CVD risk factor, cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction has not been implemented in healthcare practice. In diabetes, lower HRV is regarded as an early indicator of cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN), which is diagnosed using cardiovascular autonomic reflex tests (CARTs)[@eleftheriadou2024]. Signs of autonomic dysfunction, may already be present in individuals with prediabetes[@coopmans2020].Despite rising prevalence and increased CVD risk, people with prediabetes often remain outside structured treatment pathways [@rooney2023][@birkenfeld2024]. Although diabetes contributes to autonomic dysfunction, it is still unclear at what stage in the diabetes risk spectrum HRV and CARTs become clinically useful for assessing CVD risk.

In the past, measuring HRV needed special instruments like an electrocardiogram. Today, it's easy to track HRV with everyday devices like smartwatches[@dhingra2023][@bayoumy2021]. This increased accessibility allows for continuous monitoring and a better understanding of HRV over extended periods and under various free-living conditions[@natarajan2020]. However, long-term HRV patterns and specific diurnal responses in relation to cardiovascular complications remain less well understood.

The overall aim of this dissertation is to understand how cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction/CAN affects cardiovascular disease risk (i.e. heart failure, stroke, myocardial infarction) and specific subclinical markers of CVD: carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity and carotid artery distensibility in populations covering the whole glycemic continuum, from healthy glucose metabolism to type 2 diabetes.
