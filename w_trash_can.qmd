# Restoring para symphathetic balance

Para sympathetic balance is key in the cardiovascualr autonomic dysfunction, as it is the importatn antagonist to symphathetic activity. Howerver, restoring the balance are complex and no effective interventions has prevailed. Still, there some parts that indicates effective targets. First, controlled in- /exhale breething increases vagal activty immediately, however, if the effect remains after longer intervention remains to be determined. Second, is excersice (find information about his!!!). Direct vibarat vagus nerve stimulation has been tested but with no benifitial effect. Lastly, drug development might be a last option treatment of impaired by targeting relevant chemoreceptors.

# Lowering symphathetic activity

Is prolonged arguments by the the components in restoring parasymphathetic balance. But some can targeted to lower symphathetic activity chains by targeting parts in the chain of the systems activitation e.g. receptors at the heart. - Excercise - Beta-blocker - SGLT2-inhibitors - ?????

# MNSA for sole symphathetic measures

As HRV is determined by sinoatrial heartbeats, it does not solely reflect the sympathetic tone and is not directly measured by sympathetic activity in peripheral nerves. Further studies of MSNA in a large cohort remain needed to elucidate the independent effect of sympathetic activity on arterial stiffening \[28\]

# Long term HRV

Heart rate was measured using a combination of an accelerometer and heart rate monitor (ActiHeart, CamNTech, Cambridge, UK). This monitor records uniaxial acceleration and heart rate {Brage, 2005 #34}. The ActiHeart was placed horizontally across the participant’s chest with two standard electrocardiogram electrodes attached (Maxensor, Alton, UK). One electrode was placed at the lower end of the sternum and the other laterally on the left side of the thorax at the same horizontal level. Participants were asked to wear the device continuously for a week. The heart rate data collected during this period of daily activities was analyzed through a process of noise classification and Gaussian robust regression

HRV indices (e.i. HF, RMSSD), capturing inter-beat variability during in/expiration were less associated with the arterial stiffness. – RMSSD and HF are more effective during rest.

Enourmus calculation can be done in the data used to HRV - https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673606687357: Deccxelaration of heart rate

# HRV Maastricht Aterial stiffness

Future cohorts (i.e. observational cohort studies and trials) should incorporate such measures to obtain multiple cycles of 24-hour HRV to show how it is affected by exposures or interventions.

Hyperglycaemia, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, smoking, and physical inactivity are shared risk factors for both autonomic dysfunction and arterial stiffness \[10, 11\]

Anti-hypertensive medications, especially beta-blockers, are known to increase HRV . Because their working mechanism targets the autonomic nervous system, anti-hypertensive medication may introduce bias in the HRV measurements. However, in cohort studies, participants using anti-hypertensives in general already have lower HRV, due to compromised vascular system \[23\]. In our sensitivity analysis, without participants on anti-hypertensive treatment, the estimates did not materially change, thus we included the population and adjusted for medication in the full model.

The strengths of the study are the large sample size with a large subpopulation with type 2 diabetes and that HRV was determined by long-term 24-hour ECG recordings in free-living conditions. Recordings of 24-hour ECG traces provide a more precise estimate of cardiovascular autonomic function during the circadian rhythm\[8\]. There are also limitations to consider. First, during ECG recordings, non-stationary activity (including physical activity, meals, consumption of caffeine.) might influence the assessment of cardiovascular autonomic function \[8\]. An approach in the frequency domain to account for the non-stationarity is to take the mean across the whole recordings divided into 5-minute non-overlapping segments \[39\]. However, these recordings do not capture VLF and ULF components well, as these need measurements of long heartbeat oscillations during longer recordings. Hence, we chose to include a full cycle estimation of frequency domain HRV indices. Second, the level of HRV may depend on heart rate. We did not include adjustment of heart rate in the model as we believe it violates the principles of multicollinearity. Moreover, as a higher heart rate is determined by increased sympathetic bursts, we consider it to be a mediator on the pathway to arterial stiffness \[26\]. We have a full-day recording capturing heartbeats in rest and activity. These measures are representative of valid autonomic assessment in a full-day cycle \[8\]. We believe it is more relevant to consider the correction for heart rate in short-term recordings, as random factors (e.g time of the day, smoking, caffeine intake) can influence this standardized recording procedure \[40\]. Therefore, we argue that, in the current study, heart rate should not be included as an adjustment for either confounding or instrumental bias. Third, higher physical activity is longitudinally associated with increased HRV \[41\]. We included self-reported total physical activity to account for habitual physical activity, but we did not include accelerometer-based physical activity adjustment as this might result in over-adjusting for the concurrent physical movement on the actual day for the HRV recordings. Earlier data from The Maastricht Study confirmed that adjustment for objective physical activity of mean stepping time measured by an accelerometer did not change the estimates of their analysis of HRV compared to self-reported physical activity \[16\]. Finally, the generalizability of our findings is limited to populations including middle-aged white people with access to high-quality diabetes care. Our study is based on cross-sectional data and thus, we cannot infer a causal direction. Longitudinal data from the Whitehall study showed that a ten-year decrease in short-term 5-min HRV was associated with subsequent higher levels of aortic stiffness in a five-year trajectory \[24\], . This suggests that autonomic dysfunction is mainly contributing to arterial stiffness rather than the other way around.

## Shared consequences of dyglycemia

Both cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction and arterial stiffness are likely to be shared consequences of cardiometabolic disturbances caused by dyslipidaemia hyperinsulinemia and glycation end-products induced by hyperglycaemia, oxidative stress, and inflammation \[16, 30-32\]. The glycation end-product contributes to arterial stiffening, introduced by increased collagen levels in the arterial vessels. Also, glycation end-products and oxidative stress from hyperglycaemia contribute to neuronal damage, causing cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN) \[33, 34\]. Our results support the notion that hyperglycaemia modifies the association between HRV and PWV, as we found stronger associations in the higher quintiles of both FPG and HbA1c in non-diabetic participants . Early deterioration of glucose metabolism starts a complex cycle of complications, in this case, cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction that along with dysglycemia, likely through damaging the vagal nerves, contributes to vascular dysfunction. Moreover, sympathetic predominance under untreated dysglycemia might in combination lead to induced inflammation markers \[35\]. Thus, inflammation might play an intermediate role between autonomic dysfunction and arterial stiffness \[36\]. Two explanations might clarify why the modification did not increase by glycaemic status in the present study. First, because of being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, participants were more likely to receive cardioprotective care e.g. (glucose-lowering, lipid-lowering, and antihypertensive medication); an effect that cannot be accounted for by adjustment . The second explanation could be due to selection bias, as participants with type 2 diabetes, who participated in the Maastricht Study and underwent both long-term ECG recordings and measures of arterial stiffness might be healthier than the background population with type 2 diabetes.

# ADDITION-PRO

-   Week-long vs random 24-hour HRV

    -   THIS SHOULD BE TESTED!!!!!!!!!!!!

The increased risk is explained by a combination of elevated levels of body weight, blood glucose, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and blood pressure, as well as lifestyle factors such as unhealthy diet, smoking, and physical inactivity {Beulens, 2020 #4}.

Higher sympathetic activity causes higher cardiac workload through higher arterial tone. The partial absence of parasympathetic activity represents a missing antagonist of the sympathetic activity, and thus heart rate will likely be unchanged during rest. Therefore, the lower week-long HRV might be an indicator of autonomic dysfunction driven by more chronic sympathetic dominance that leads to poorer deceleration of heart rate, changes of hemodynamics, and direct arterial constriction {Nardone, 2020 #25}. These components of higher pulse, increased cardiac workload and vasoconstriction in the long term cause pathological cardiac and arterial remodeling, which in turn increases the risk of ischemic events and heart failure. Our findings show that higher heart rate in the night hours is a strong indicator for both heart failure, CVD, and mortality. These findings may highlight the absent parasympathetic activity during the sleeping/resting hours leading to minor changes in heart rate.

Lower week-long HRV might be an indicator of autonomic dysfunction driven by more chronic sympathetic dominance that leads to poorer deceleration of heart rate, changes of hemodynamics, and direct arterial constriction, thus {Nardone, 2020 #25}. Higher sympathetic activity causes higher cardiac workload through higher arterial tone, and thus heart rate will likely be unchanged during rest. Our findings show that higher heart rate in the night hours is a strong indicator for both heart failure, CVD, and mortality. These findings may highlight the absent parasympathetic activity during the sleeping/resting hours leading to minor changes in heart rate. The components of higher pulse, increased cardiac workload and vasoconstriction in the long term cause pathological cardiac and arterial remodeling, which in turn increases the risk of ischemic events and heart failure

A study found that higher peaks of high-frequency HRV and increases in IBI during the night were observed in controls, whereas both the HF and IBI peek was missing in participants with type 2 diabetes {Spallone, 1993 #27}. Studies using high-frequency HRV measures are needed to confirm if the absence of parasympathetic activity explains the association with CVD endpoints during these hours. The explanation of the sympathetic overactivity is complex in whether the underlying cause is nerve damage or a compensating mechanism to keep sufficient ejection fraction (ref.). Therefore, we cannot exclude that higher heart rate might be an early indicator for progression to heart failure, as loss of ejection fraction needs compensation by higher sympathetic activity, leading to higher heart rate that is needed throughout the day and night.

Our results underscore that poor autonomic nervous adaptation is not only linked with a high risk of CVD, but also a higher risk of all-cause mortality, indicating low . In the morning hours, the heart needs to make its biggest shift in adaptation with the increase in sympathetic activity as the body experiences a peak in cortisol and changes from a longer rest to rise and movement {Boudreau, 2011 #32}. Our results emphasize that autonomic dysfunctional response in the morning, measured by lower HRV, is the strongest hourly indicator for higher risk of acute CVD endpoints and cardiovascular mortality. Thus, poor autonomic nervous adaptation, by parasympathetic impairment and sympathetic hyperresponsiveness, results in lower adaptability to external and internal requirements from target organs regulated by the autonomic nervous system { Rana, 2020 #35}{Herring, 2019 #23}.

Autonomic dysfunction is consequence of deteriorated cardiometabolic environment {Rinaldi, 2023 #33} {Schlaich, 2015 #19}. Findings from the Maastricht study, showed that the association between autonomic dysfunction, measured by 24-hour HRV, and subclinical measures of CVD, by arterial stiffness, was more pronounced among people with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes (ref. our Maastricht paper) compared with people with normal glucose metabolism. Thus, the presence of a vicious cardiometabolic cycle involving autonomic dysfunction may contribute to both ischemic events and heart failure and is especially expressed in populations with high risk of diabetes and overt diabetes.

In clinical practice, systolic blood pressure has ascertained as the most important dynamic measure in both prognosis and prevention in CVD (ref.). As other dynamic cardiovascular measures of heart rate and HRV become more accessible by wearable devices, revisiting the use of these dynamic measures in prevention of CVD has become more relevant as a potential tool in monitoring successfulness of cardiometabolic risk management. In diabetes, more wearable technologies are used for treatment and prevention, such as continuous glucose monitors. Additionally, the increase in the use of smartwatches and other wearable devices allows the monitoring of physiological data, such as pulse, heart rate, heart rate variability, blood oxygen, sleep quality, temperature, and physical activity {Keshet, 2023 #36}. Hence, wearable devices have potential to improve health monitoring and facilitate targeted intervention based on physiological data. Both long-term and hourly mHR and HRV contain relevant information about CVD and mortality risk. Monitoring mHR and HRV could help us maintain the cardiovascular autonomic function which might be a key in maintaining health-span in high-risk individuals. Future studies should explore the added predictive value and determine at which diabetes risk level (people with no diabetes, high risk of diabetes, or diagnosed type 2 diabetes) compares to conventional risk factors to determine improved discrimination using HRV measures.

Our study shows that SDNN can be regarded as a marker for the health of the cardiovascular autonomic function that is linked with future cardiovascular disease and mortality. We have highlighted that mHR and SDNN provide information about CVD risk from different hourly segments to long-term recordings. Based on our data, autonomic dysfunction measured in the morning hours are shown to have higher risk of ischemic events. The morning HRV may represent an indicator for morning autonomic response, that is stronger linked to MACE compared to the rest of the day response, and thus gives a notion for risk assessing time point in free living condition. All hours of SDNN had the same trends and magnitude of association with all-cause mortality. This suggests SDNN levels throughout the day (i.e. sleeping, waking, responding to physical movement, stress) are all indicative of mortality risk.

TINN, SDANN, and SDNNi showed similar trends in association as SDNN. As we did not have the successive IBI from the ActiHeart, we were not able to calculate frequency-domain indices to capture short and long IBI oscillation. Further studies will be relevant to uncover the association of different frequency sources from long-term HRV and hourly HRV with CVD and mortality. This could uncover whether the oscillation during inspiration and expiration or longer oscillations explain these trends in the link between autonomic health and cardiovascular disease, especially in the diurnal variation of HRV. Participants in the ADDITION-PRO were invited based on a diabetes risk score and tested for impaired glucose metabolism and has been followed up on disease events for over a decade. Therefore, our results highlight the potential use of measuring week long heart rate and its variability for assessing CVD risk among people with high risk of diabetes. Further studies are needed to determine whether these associations are valid in the general population, and in which degree of population of risk and age groups HRV proves as a potential marker of CVD risk.

wearable devices have potential to improve health monitoring and facilitate targeted and individualized intervention based on physiological data (i.e heart rate, HRV, blood oxygen, sleep quality, temperature, and physical activity) {Keshet, 2023 #36}.

ADDITION-PRO aims to investigate the etiology, pathophysiology, complications, and comorbidities of type 2 diabetes through extensive phenotyping and has been previously described {Johansen, 2012 #15}. IPrior CVD events can alter HRV, increase the risk of recurrent CVD, and lead to higher mortality risk. Therefore, individuals with prior CVD events within 10 years before inclusion in ADDITION-PRO were excluded from this analysis.

Studies have demonstrated that autonomic dysfunction (assesed by short periodtime ECG´s is linked with CVD when assessing lower short-term heart rate variability, measuring ECG patterns in supine rest during inspiration and expiration during time-periods of 10-seconds to 5 minutes (ref)

Perhaps autonomic dysfunction contributes subtly to making other conditions worse.. for example cancer patients may die a little bit earlier if they also have autonomic dysfunction, with a small but important cardiovascular component.. As there is a bigger diagnosis, this vascular component will not often be coded adequately on the mortality report

# HICD

In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) based on large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, has become accessible to everyone with a computer or smartphone, demonstrating the rapid acceleration in generative AI. The use of LLMs can revolutionise various domains by handling large volumes of text, generating human-like responses, and facilitating natural language interactions (ref).

The demand for caregivers is increasing, and AI might assist with this shortage {Azzopardi-Muscat, 2023 #11}. In high-income countries, mortality rates are decreasing in both populations with and without diabetes (ref mortality paper). However, these changes in trends are resulting in ageing populations that are living with more comorbidities (Tinnes paper?) that need attention and care. Therefore, early detection of disease risk, lifestyle support, and faster and equal access to care remain crucial. LLMs have the potential to assist in these domains and unload health care burdens i.e. by handling multiple large text documents, such as electronic health records, summarising knowledge, and facilitating interaction through speech (Yang, 2022) (ref. about speech).

People with diabetes have much to gain from LLMs in their treatment and monitoring of disease risk. However, explainability of the decision of AI and whether they trust its decisions remains important (ref.). Diabetes patients routinely share various types of data, such as medication information, continuous glucose monitoring readings, eye images, electrocardiograms, biochemical markers, and blood pressure measurements, all of which are summarised into large electronic health records (ref.). Multimodal models, including transformers, can handle increased amounts and types of data analysis with vast speed, potentially improving approaches in the prevention and management of cardiometabolic diseases {Muse, 2024 #10}{Kline, 2022 #9}. However, the decisions made by these complex models are often seen as a “black box” by both the caregivers and patients. Beyond striving to make model decisions more explainable, trust from patients in these models is key to their supported decision-making. Therefore, understanding people’s perceptions and the underlying traits associated with trust in LLMs is important before implementing such models.

People’s perception of AI varies across different healthcare scenarios, with AI generally being accepted as long as healthcare providers maintain control. The use of chat-bots in contact with health services is the most controversial {Schaarup, 2023 #2}{Tran, 2019 #8}. Since then, the acceleration of AI has made advanced tools like ChatGPT and BARD available to the general population (ref.). The use of large language models (LLMs) has not been well documented among such populations, nor has their perception of its use in healthcare been widely studied after the launch of these models. Furthermore, questions about public perception regarding the extent to which scenarios chat-bots are accepted, and whether this acceptance depends on its characteristics, such as the acuteness, remain to be ascertained. Gaining a better understanding of these attitudes may influence how LLMs are tailored and implemented in health care.

In the implementation of such advanced models, there are many ethical and regulatory challenges, including data protection and the safe implementation of the applications {Ong, 2024 #1}.

Training machine learning models, which are the building blocks for AI-based solutions, requires a large amount of data. Newer models (e.i. transformers), can handle data with high complexity (i.e. text, images, audio). Although the majority are in general open to sharing data with public organisations (ref HICD 2022), some types of complex individual data are becoming more sensitive, that the public might not be comfortable with. Thus, there is a need to describe population attitudes of sharing different types of data and whether these attitudes differ between sharing with public and private institutions.

(The descriptive difference between openness to share different types of data were randomised to answer into either public or private institutions. )

We aim to determine the trust of LLMs in healthcare, and how the trust depends on health care scenarios. Moreover, we will identify traits that are associated with trusting LLM solutions. Based on our findings from the HICD 2022 2024 investigation we will summarise recommendations from patients populations perspectives.

Questions about sharing different types of data included whether participants would share information from health records, images from scans, audio recordings from consultations, and genetic data. The participants were randomised to address these questions sharing data with either public or private organisations (see Fig 1).

## Discussion

 Many of these tasks could be efficiently supported by chatbots, such as providing information about symptoms, offering lifestyle advice, and explaining medication side effects. Additionally, chatbots could assist in monitoring the progression of complications by analysing text from electronic health records.

# CANCAN

HRV was obtained from all CART, using spectral analysis based on an autoregressive modeling approach. Time domain measures included the standard deviation of normal-to-normal intervals (SDNN) and the root mean square of successive differences between normal-to-normal heartbeats (RMSSD). Frequency domain metrics comprised the low-frequency power band (LF: 0.04–0.15 Hz), high-frequency power band (HF: 0.15–0.4 Hz), and total power.

History of CVD are a risk factor for CAN and higher levels of NT-proBNP (ref.). In guidelines for the detection of HF, patients with prior cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction, or stroke are already considered a patient group who may benefit from routine measurement of NT-proBNP \[30\].

$$

Trails has demonstrated intensive glucose and blood pressure management have low efficacy in improving CAN \[32\]. SGLT2 inhibitors and finerenone protect against HF and kidney function decline, which are complications of CAN , but their potential effect in patients with CAN on cardiorenal outcomes progression requires further investigation \[6\]. Since there is no proven effective treatment for CAN, the focus may shift toward managing the cardiovascular consequences associated with CAN.

# Dissertation

However, as was asses only nervous response through variation of heart beat, structured studies with precise measures of sympathetic activity are needed to test these hypotheses and confirm them in humans.

*Physiological precise sympathetic and parasympathetic measures*

As HRV is determined by sinoatrial heartbeats, it does not solely reflect the sympathetic tone and is not directly measured by sympathetic activity in peripheral nerves. Further studies of MSNA in a large cohort remain needed to elucidate the independent effect of sympathetic activity on arterial stiffening \[ref\].

In humans, direct measurement of parasympathetic nervous activity is challenging. Although acetylcholine is the primary neurotransmitter of the parasympathetic nervous system, its concentration is not practically measurable due to its rapid degradation by acetylcholinesterase, its highly localized synaptic activity, and lack of systemic spillover (ref.). Therefore, indirect assessments are preferred. Commonly used surrogate measures include high-frequency HRV, respiratory sinus arrhythmia, baroreflex sensitivity, and responses to pharmacological agents like atropine. These physiological markers provide insight into vagal tone and parasympathetic activity, although each method has limitations (ref.).

## Perspectives Autonomic dysfunction and cardiovascular risk - pathofysiology

Long-term HRV can serve as a risk indicator and may be divided into segments to identify responses with important implications for disease. Both long-term HRV and its hourly variation can be modulated through interventions targeting lifestyle patterns or medication. However, whether such modulation leads to a reduction in cardiovascular disease risk remains unproven. If subclinical autonomic dysfunction is not addressed, there may be a risk of further progression, including stages such as resting tachycardia with sympathetic overdrive, exercise intolerance, and orthostatic hypotension, where both the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems fail to modulate appropriately (see Figure X).

The availability of wearable devices such as smartwatches is expanding the scale of physiological data collection. Data such as heart rate, temperature, and physical acceleration can now be easily obtained under free-living conditions or through app-guided tests. This opens new opportunities to study heart rate responses in everyday life. Combining heart rate with additional physiological signals may improve understanding of CVD risk. Machine learning methods could further help to integrate heart rate and movement data, identifying early signs and patterns in response in the daily cycle that is linked to CVD risk.

## Suggestions to use - conclusions

This thesis demonstrates that cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction, assessed through long-term heart rate variability (HRV) and cardiovascular autonomic reflex tests (CART), is associated with increased cardiovascular risk across the glycemic spectrum. Reduced HRV was linked to greater arterial stiffness, higher incidence of ischemic cardiovascular events, heart failure, and all-cause mortality. These associations were particularly pronounced in individuals with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, suggesting that autonomic dysfunction may serve as an early marker of cardiovascular vulnerability.

While these findings support the prognostic value of HRV and CART, the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. It is unclear whether autonomic dysfunction plays a causal role in the development of arteriosclerosis, atherosclerosis, and cardiac remodeling, or whether it reflects downstream effects of metabolic and vascular stress. The modifying role of dysglycemia further highlights the complex interplay between metabolic and autonomic pathways.

Importantly, this work underscores the potential of HRV and CART as tools for cardiovascular risk stratification and early detection of subclinical disease. However, their clinical utility depends on further validation through causal inference methods, such as Mendelian randomization, and structured mediation analyses in intervention trials.

Future research should focus on standardizing long-term HRV measurement, integrating wearable technologies for continuous monitoring, and evaluating whether interventions targeting autonomic function can reduce cardiovascular risk. If validated, HRV and CART could become valuable components of precision prevention strategies in cardiometabolic care.

. However, more physiological studies are needed to understand the mechanisms of atherosclerosis in the presence of autonomic nervous dysfunction, including the causal direction between the two. , as well as markers of endothelial dysfunction, beyond what is currently captured by HRV and common indices of arterial stiffness.\[Thus, although long-term HRV may lack the precision to disentangle sympathetic and parasympathetic activity due to overlapping behavioral and physiological influences, it may be a valuable tool for assessing autonomic responses in free-living conditions and informing lifestyle-based strategies to improve cardiovascular health. Hence, HRV show potential as a responsive marker to monitor successfullness in CVD risk management.\]

Sympathetic activity in humans can be evaluated using a variety of complementary techniques. 1)Hemodynamic methods assess vascular responses to stressors such as cold exposure, isometric exercise, and orthostatic challenges, often focusing on regional blood flow changes in organs like the kidneys, muscles, and splanchnic circulation.Pharmacological approaches involve the administration of adrenergic or ganglionic blockers to isolate the sympathetic contribution to vascular tone and regional blood flow.Biochemical techniques include the measurement of catecholamines and their metabolites in plasma and urine. While these provide indirect estimates of sympathetic activity, more advanced neurochemical methods—such as radiotracer-based noradrenaline spillover—allow for quantification of neurotransmitter release at both systemic and organ-specific levels.Microneurography offers a direct neurophysiological approach by recording sympathetic nerve traffic in peripheral nerves, particularly those innervating muscle and skin. This method enables real-time monitoring of sympathetic discharge patterns in response to various stimuli.Finally, neural imaging techniques such as PET and SPECT scans use radiolabeled tracers to visualize sympathetic innervation and function in target organs. These methods provide anatomical and functional insights into sympathetic nerve distribution and activity, particularly in clinical and research settings.

## Aim

I further assess the role of cardiovascular autonomic function in healthcare, particularly in risk stratification and enabling the early detection of individuals at high risk for cardiovascular complications.

## Discussion

Chronic hyperglycemia, reflected in elevated HbA1c levels, promotes the formation of advanced glycation end products and the overproduction of reactive oxygen species[@ritchie2020]. These byproducts contribute to oxidative stress, which in turn exacerbates autonomic dysfunction, often evidenced by reduced HRV[@meerwaldt2005][@lee2020]. 

 I suspect that the deterioration of HRV indicators may partly reflect the pathogenesis of autonomic neuropathy, as a consequence of harmful byproducts resulting from hyperglycemia.

## Perspectives

In our multiday recordings, our data likely captured episodes of stress-induced HRV under free-living conditions, such as during the awakening stages in the morning. Capturing autonomic responses to daily living and their alignment with circadian rhythms may provide valuable insights into cardiovascular risk. Therefore, understanding autonomic responses to tasks is relevant for comprehending their role in cardiovascular risk, beyond short-term measures taken at rest. Including data to monitor real-time activity, such as physical activity, would add value by capturing physiological responses to bodily demands. This could enable the inclusion of heart rate responses (e.g., from rest to standing) and other relevant measures of autonomic function, such as heart rate recovery after physical movement, which is a known risk factor for cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality [@colechristopherr][@vandevegte].
