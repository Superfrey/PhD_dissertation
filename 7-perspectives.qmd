Autonomic dysfunction and cardiovascular risk - pathofysiology

Long-term HRV can serve as a risk indicator and may be divided into segments to identify responses with important implications for disease. Both long-term HRV and its hourly variation can be modulated through interventions targeting lifestyle patterns or medication. However, whether such modulation leads to a reduction in cardiovascular disease risk remains unproven. If subclinical autonomic dysfunction is not addressed, there may be a risk of further progression, including stages such as resting tachycardia with sympathetic overdrive, exercise intolerance, and orthostatic hypotension, where both the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems fail to modulate appropriately (see Figure X).

The availability of wearable devices such as smartwatches is expanding the scale of physiological data collection. Data such as heart rate, temperature, and physical acceleration can now be easily obtained under free-living conditions or through app-guided tests. This opens new opportunities to study heart rate responses in everyday life. Combining heart rate with additional physiological signals may improve understanding of CVD risk. Machine learning methods could further help to integrate heart rate and movement data, identifying early signs and patterns in response in the daily cycle that is linked to CVD risk.

## Risk-stratification

People at high risk of diabetes, with glucose levels in the prediabetic range, face an increased risk of developing diabetes and its complications. However, since many individuals either remain in the prediabetic state or revert to normoglycemia, structured treatment strategies for prediabetes have not been widely implemented in clinical practice. This is partly due to the high heterogeneity within the prediabetic population. Therefore, additional indicators beyond glucose levels may be useful to identify individuals who are most likely to benefit from early intervention. In Studies I and II, we demonstrated that autonomic dysfunction, as measured by long-term HRV, was more strongly associated with cardiovascular risk in this population. Future directions include evaluating whether individuals classified as high-risk based on autonomic dysfunction may benefit from targeted interventions. However, a limitation of long-term HRV measurement is the lack of standardization, as data are collected under free-living conditions and may be influenced by daily behaviors, and thus effecting classification as.

In terms of clinical application, the VAGUS device may serve as an effective strategy for screening autonomic dysfunction, as the CART has been shown to be reliable \[\@fleischer2011\]. The measurement is non-invasive and typically takes 8â€“10 minutes to complete. While some CART indices may be influenced by the time of day or recent physical activity, these effects are generally considered minimal. Additionally, no impact of caffeine intake on the results was observed \[\@hansen2025\].

## Continuous monitoring of cardiovascular health

Over recent years, the use of wearable devices has increased in the general population [@dhingra2023], allowing comprehensive data collection of behavioral (sleep and physical activity) and physiological (heart rate, ECG, temperature, etc.) parameters [@keshet2023]. Wearable devices open up broader and more feasible data collection of heart rate over long-term periods, which is less demanding in terms of equipment compared to Holter monitors.

Study I and II demonstrate the link between long-term HRV and CVD risk, and the stronger association in stages of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. Thus, a perspective of wearable devices, e.g., smartwatches, is to monitor HRV in individuals at higher cardiometabolic risk and use available HRV measures to guide the progression of cardiometabolic risk. In the Whitehall II study, we demonstrated that a steeper 10-year decrease in 5-minute HRV was linked with higher aortic stiffness development in the subsequent 5 years \[\@schaarup2023\]. Thus, a decreasing tendency of HRV detected by smartwatches may help indicate individuals who need more intensively interventions.

In study II, we observed specific morning time point link to CVD, suggesting responses during free-living condition captures information about CVD risk. Instead of controlling for physical movement, prediction models, could seek to incorporate multimodal data e.g. heart rate. sleep and physical activity which in combination give a picture of CVD risk by their constellation and give suggestions to modified the risk.

Standardization and transparency across brands of wearable devices remain a challenge for both research and the implementation of heart rate and HRV monitoring, particularly in relation to their response to behavioral factors. While smartwatches offer a convenient way to measure heart rate, their precision can vary, as the readings are based on photoplethysmography , which detects pulse at the wrist. This method can be imprecise under certain conditions, particularly during physical activity, due to motion artifacts and other external factors.


## Effective causal modifiable marker

-   Medelian randomization

-   Medation in trails in CVD prevention

-   Target trail improves outcome

-   Experimental design of mediation of direct target of HRV (medication: beta-blockers, or lifestyle: physical activity, diet and sleep)

-   It is responsive.....

The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) showed that HRV may modify the effect of lifestyle intervention in preventing type 2 diabetes[@carnethon2006]. However, it remains unclear to what extent this modification applies to cardiovascular outcomes, and whether the intervention was more effective among individuals with lower HRV.

Similar people with type 2 diabetes from young age to a majority of older population. In many cases for prevention effective physical acitivity programs may be out of scope for the more fragile patients, and thus management of medication seems the choice.

*Physiological precise sympathetic and parasympathetic measures*

As HRV is determined by sinoatrial heartbeats, it does not solely reflect the sympathetic tone and is not directly measured by sympathetic activity in peripheral nerves. Further studies of MSNA in a large cohort remain needed to elucidate the independent effect of sympathetic activity on arterial stiffening \[ref\].

In humans, direct measurement of parasympathetic nervous activity is challenging. Although acetylcholine is the primary neurotransmitter of the parasympathetic nervous system, its concentration is not practically measurable due to its rapid degradation by acetylcholinesterase, its highly localized synaptic activity, and lack of systemic spillover (ref.). Therefore, indirect assessments are preferred. Commonly used surrogate measures include high-frequency HRV, respiratory sinus arrhythmia, baroreflex sensitivity, and responses to pharmacological agents like atropine. These physiological markers provide insight into vagal tone and parasympathetic activity, although each method has limitations (ref.).
