Autonomic dysfunction and cardiovascular risk - pathofysiology

Long-term HRV can serve as a risk indicator and may be divided into segments to identify responses with important implications for disease. Both long-term HRV and its hourly variation can be modulated through interventions targeting lifestyle patterns or medication. However, whether such modulation leads to a reduction in cardiovascular disease risk remains unproven. If subclinical autonomic dysfunction is not addressed, there may be a risk of further progression, including stages such as resting tachycardia with sympathetic overdrive, exercise intolerance, and orthostatic hypotension, where both the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems fail to modulate appropriately (see Figure X).

The availability of wearable devices such as smartwatches is expanding the scale of physiological data collection. Data such as heart rate, temperature, and physical acceleration can now be easily obtained under free-living conditions or through app-guided tests. This opens new opportunities to study heart rate responses in everyday life. Combining heart rate with additional physiological signals may improve understanding of CVD risk. Machine learning methods could further help to integrate heart rate and movement data, identifying early signs and patterns in response in the daily cycle that is linked to CVD risk.

## Risk-stratification

Individuals with elevated glucose levels are at increased risk of developing metabolic complications and cardiovascular disease. However, many remain metabolically stable or even return to normal glucose regulation over time. As a result, structured treatment strategies for this group have not been widely adopted in clinical practice. This is partly due to the high degree of heterogeneity within this population. Therefore, additional indicators beyond glucose levels may be useful to identify those most likely to benefit from early intervention.

In Studies I and II, we demonstrated that autonomic dysfunction, as measured by long-term HRV, was more strongly associated with cardiovascular risk in this population. These findings suggest that HRV may serve as a valuable marker for identifying individuals at elevated risk who could benefit from targeted preventive strategies. Future directions include evaluating whether individuals classified as high-risk based on autonomic dysfunction respond to specific interventions. However, a limitation of long-term HRV measurement is the lack of standardization, as data are collected under free-living conditions and may be influenced by daily behaviors, potentially affecting risk classification.

From a clinical perspective, CART offers a practical approach to screening for autonomic dysfunction, as the test has been shown to be reliable [@fleischer2011]. It is non-invasive and typically takes 8 to 10 minutes to complete. While some CART indices may be influenced by the time of day or recent physical activity, these effects are generally considered minimal. Additionally, no impact of caffeine intake on the reference age-specific values was observed [@hansen2025].

In Study III, we demonstrated a relationship between CAN and cardiac dysfunction, as measured by NT-proBNP. Depsite . Heart failure is characterized by both structural and functional changes in the heart, such as left ventricular dysfunction, which can be assessed using echocardiography. However, the link between these structural and functional changes and their impact on systolic and diastolic pumping function in relation to CAN remains to be fully understood. Furthermore, the diagnostic and prognostic value of CAN, particularly its sensitivity and specificity in detecting HFrEF and HFpEF, requires further investigation.

## Continuous monitoring of cardiovascular health

Over recent years, the use of wearable devices has increased in the general population [@dhingra2023], enabling comprehensive data collection on behavioral (e.g., sleep and physical activity) and physiological (e.g., heart rate, ECG, temperature) parameters [@keshet2023]. These devices offer a broader and more feasible approach to long-term heart rate monitoring, requiring less equipment and user burden compared to traditional Holter monitors. Despite growing interest in wearable-based monitoring, the integration of HRV into routine cardiometabolic risk assessment remains limited.

Studies I and II demonstrated a strong association between long-term HRV and CVD risk, with particularly pronounced associations in individuals with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. These findings suggest that HRV metrics could serve as early indicators for stratifying individuals who may benefit from preventive interventions. In the Whitehall II study, we further showed that a steeper 10-year decline in 5-minute HRV was associated with greater aortic stiffness development over the subsequent five years [@schaarup2023]. Thus, a declining HRV trend detected by smartwatches may help identify individuals who require more intensive interventions.

In Study II, we also observed that specific morning time points were linked to CVD risk, suggesting that physiological responses captured under free-living conditions may provide valuable insights. Rather than adjusting for physical activity as a confounder, future predictive models could integrate multimodal data such as HRV, sleep, and activity patterns to capture dynamic physiological states and improve risk prediction. Incorporating HRV into digital health platforms may support personalized feedback loops, enabling timely lifestyle or therapeutic adjustments.

Hence, future studies can leverage wearable devices to continuously monitor risk by HRV and better understand the behavioral factors that contribute to its improvement or deterioration. This approach may help identify effective lifestyle patterns or medications that improve cardiovascular health through modulation of HRV.

However, standardization and transparency across different brands of wearable devices remain a challenge for both research and clinical implementation of heart rate and HRV monitoring. While smartwatches offer a convenient method for heart rate measurement, their accuracy can vary, as they rely on photoplethysmography to detect pulse rate at the wrist. This method can be imprecise under certain conditions, particularly during physical activity, due to motion artifacts and other external factors[@fuller2020]. Despite these limitations, ongoing improvements in sensor technology and algorithm calibration are likely to enhance the reliability of wearable-derived heart rate and HRV data.

## Effective causal modifiable marker

Our findings in Studies I and II support the etiological link between long-term heart rate variability and the risk of cardiovascular disease, which provide a first line of evidence of a causal relationship. However, the observed association does not imply causation, and further research is necessary to determine whether the relationship between heart rate variability and cardiovascular disease risk is indeed causal. Traditionally, epidemiological research has relied on randomized controlled trials to establish causal relationships. However, conducting such trials to isolate the direct of heart rate variability is particularly challenging. Interventions that modify heart rate variability often do so indirectly, through changes in lifestyle factors such as weight loss, inflammation, or insulin sensitivity, or through pharmacological treatments like blood pressure medications. As a result, isolating the direct modification of heart rate variability is difficult. To address these limitations, modern epidemiological approaches such as Mendelian randomization (MR)[@daveysmith2014] and structured causal mediation analysis offer promising alternatives for inferring causality from observational data \[modern epidemiology 4th edition\].

A genome-wide association study (GWAS) has identified 17 lead single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across eight loci associated with HRV based on short-term recordings, suggesting the potential for these variants to serve as genetic instruments in Mendelian randomization analyses [@nolte2017]. Another study demonstrated that phenotypically measured HRV was associated with all-cause mortality but found no evidence of a genetic association between genes linked to HRV and all-cause mortality [@tegegne2023]. To date, no GWAS has been conducted to investigate the genetic determinants of long-term HRV. Establishing such genetic associations is essential for understanding its genetic architecture and evaluating its potential causal role in cardiovascular disease.

The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) showed that HRV may modify the effect of lifestyle intervention in preventing type 2 diabetes[@carnethon2006]. However, it remains unclear to what extent this modification applies to cardiovascular outcomes, and whether the intervention was more effective among individuals with lower HRV.

\[Closer attention to the mechanisms underlying autonomic dysfunction offers promising opportunities for identifying new intervention targets. While it is plausible that multifactorial risk management may slow the progression of arterial stiffening in part by modulating autonomic function, it remains unproven whether direct modification of heart rate variability (HRV) itself causally reduces cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Recent Mendelian randomization studies have emerged as a valuable tool to explore such causal relationships, offering unconfounded estimates by using genetic variants as proxies for exposures.

. These studies can provide a first line of evidence to assess whether HRV is a modifiable causal factor in CVD development. Furthermore, cardiometabolic intervention trials—whether focused on lifestyle modification or pharmacological treatment—should, where feasible, include HRV measurements to enable structured mediation analyses and better understand the role of autonomic function in cardiovascular outcomes.\]
