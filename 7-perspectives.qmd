We have discussed the mechanisms and clinical implications of cardiovascular autonomic function across different stages of glucose metabolism. Based on our findings and discussion, we propose further perspectives to define its role in research and healthcare from three aspects: (1) continuous non-invasive health monitoring, (2) risk stratification, and (3) identification as a causal and modifiable marker.

## Continuous monitoring of cardiovascular health

Understanding when and how physiological signals reflect elevated CVD risk is essential for developing early and effective prevention strategies. Incorporating HRV into digital health-solutions could support personalized feedback mechanisms, enabling timely lifestyle or therapeutic interventions and contributing to more adaptive and preventive healthcare strategies.
Wearable devices enables comprehensive data collection on behavioral (e.g., sleep and physical activity) and physiological (e.g., heart rate, ECG, temperature) parameters [@keshet2023]. These devices offer a broader and more feasible approach to long-term heart rate monitoring. Despite growing interest in wearable-based monitoring, the integration of HRV into routine cardiometabolic risk assessment remains limited. 

Two key aspects highlight the potential applications of monitoring: (1) identification of risk and (2) assessment of response to intervention.

*Identification of risk*

We ascertained that lower long-term HRV is a risk factor for CVD, as demonstrated by its association with arterial stiffness and hard CVD endpoints. In addition, our findings that specific time points of HRV and heart rate are associated with increased risk of CVD and heart failure suggest that distinct physiological responses captured under free-living conditions may enhance early risk detection. The majority of the observed associations were not explained by movement at the corresponding time points. For risk assessment, instead of merely adjusting for physical activity as a confounding factor, future predictive models could benefit from integrating multiple physiological signals such as HRV, sleep, and activity patterns to better reflect dynamic states of health. Machine learning techniques offer the ability to process complex raw time-series data, such as interbeat intervals and accelerometer signals, and to uncover patterns that may improve risk prediction beyond conventional summary measures of HRV. However, a key limitation of these models is their reduced explainability, which may limit their clinical applicability. 

*Assessment of response to intervention*

HRV highlights a potential target for intervention, given that low HRV may be indicative of adverse lifestyle patterns. For instance, behavioral patterns such as disrupted sleep or irregular meal timing may influence circadian fluctuations in HRV. Evidence from studies on night-shift workers suggests that meal timing affects HRV, with daytime meals leading to higher HRV during night hours [@chellappa2025]. Medications such as beta-blockers and GLP-1 receptor agonists have been shown to influence autonomic function, with effects observed in both 24-hour and hourly HRV measures[@niemel√§1994][@kumarathurai2016].

Future studies can leverage wearable devices to better understand the behavioral factors and treatment options that contribute to its improvement or deterioration of HRV. This approach may help identify effective lifestyle patterns or medications that improve success of cardiovascular health through modulation of HRV.

Standardization and transparency across different brands of wearable devices remain a challenge for both research and clinical implementation of heart rate and HRV monitoring. While smartwatches offer a convenient method for heart rate measurement, their accuracy can vary, as they rely on photoplethysmography to detect pulse rate at the wrist. This method can be imprecise under certain conditions, particularly during physical activity, due to motion artifacts and other external factors[@fuller2020]. Despite these limitations, ongoing improvements in sensor technology and algorithm calibration are likely to enhance the reliability of wearable-derived heart rate and HRV data.

## Risk-stratification

Based on the clinical implications, the distinct roles of long-term HRV and CART in risk stratification remain to be demonstrated and require further investigation.

From the perspective of wearable devices, it remains to be determined whether HRV can serve as an early indicator of CVD risk when used in a risk score alongside simple non-invasive markers such as age, sex, and BMI, and how it compares to current CVD risk scores that include blood-based biomarkers and blood pressure.

A limitation of long-term HRV measurement is the lack of standardization, as data are collected under free-living conditions and may be influenced by daily behaviors, potentially affecting risk classification. Therefore, standardized procedures may be necessary. CART has been shown to be a reliable, non-invasive method that typically takes approximately 10 minutes to complete. As such, a standardized and validated diagnosis of CAN can help identify patients with type 2 diabetes who are at higher risk of CVD, nephropathy, and heart failure. However, the extent to which the diagnosis of CAN identifies heart failure risk and is generalisable to broader populations with type 2 diabetes or even prediabetes, in a clinically relevant context, remains to be assessed.

Our findings suggest that long-term HRV and CAN may serve as a potential marker for CVD and heart failure risk among individuals at elevated metabolic risk, helping to identify those who could benefit from preventive strategies. Future research should evaluate whether individuals classified as high-risk based on autonomic dysfunction or CAN should initiate cardiovascular-focused prevention or screening earlier, or receive specific interventions tailored to their condition.

## Effective causal modifiable marker

-   clinical trails
-   lifestyle intervention

Our findings support the etiological link between long-term HRV and the risk of CVD, which provide a first line of evidence of a causal relationship. However, the observed association does not imply causation, and further research is necessary to determine whether the relationship between HRV and CVD risk is indeed causal. Traditionally, epidemiological research has relied on randomized controlled trials to establish causal relationships. However, conducting such trials to isolate the direct of HRV is particularly challenging. Interventions that modify HRV often do so indirectly, through changes in lifestyle factors such as weight loss, inflammation, or insulin sensitivity, or through pharmacological treatments like blood pressure medications. As a result, isolating the direct modification of HRV is difficult. To address these limitations of clinical trail, modern epidemiological approaches such as Mendelian randomization (MR)[@daveysmith2014] and structured causal mediation analysis offer promising alternatives for inferring causality from observational data \[modern epidemiology 4th edition\].

A genome-wide association study (GWAS) has identified 17 lead single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across eight loci associated with HRV based on short-term recordings, suggesting the potential for these variants to serve as genetic instruments in Mendelian randomization analyses [@nolte2017]. Another study demonstrated that phenotypically measured HRV was associated with all-cause mortality but found no evidence of a genetic association between genes linked to HRV and all-cause mortality [@tegegne2023]. To date, no GWAS has been conducted to investigate the genetic determinants of long-term HRV. Establishing such genetic associations is essential for understanding its genetic architecture and for providing unconfounded estimates by using genetic variants as proxies to assess the causal role of HRV in CVD.

A study have demonstrated that reduced HRV mediates the association between glomerular hyperfiltration and mortality [@chang2021a], indicating an initial potential for HRV as a modifying factor. While this has been shown in observational data, no evidence of such mediation has yet been established in trial data. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) showed that HRV may modify the effect of lifestyle intervention in preventing type 2 diabetes [@carnethon2006]. However, it remains unclear to what extent this modification applies to cardiovascular outcomes, and whether the intervention was more effective among individuals with lower HRV. Cardiometabolic intervention trials, whether focused on lifestyle modification or pharmacological treatment, should, where feasible, include HRV measurements to enable structured mediation analyses and to better understand the role of autonomic function in cardiovascular outcomes. This could help demonstrate whether modification of HRV through potential strategies such as medications like beta-blockers or lifestyle interventions including physical activity, diet, and sleep has a sustainable effect on CVD outcomes.

 In addition, we found that HRV was associated with locally measured carotid distensibility. However, our results are limited by the inability to distinguish between sympathetic and parasympathetic contributions to arterial stiffness, or to determine whether the observed risk is driven by specific responses to living conditions or circadian rhythm variations.

As increased sympathetic nervous system activity has been linked to greater plaque formation, and may be modifiable by reducing sympathetic drive, the autonomic nervous system could play a role in reducing atherosclerotic thrombus formation. However, more physiological studies are needed to understand the mechanisms of atherosclerosis in the presence of autonomic nervous dysfunction, including the causal direction between the two, and how this interplay may be altered during the progression from normal glucose metabolism to type 2 diabetes. This requires more precise measures of both sympathetic and parasympathetic activity, as well as markers of endothelial dysfunction, beyond what is currently captured by HRV and common indices of arterial stiffness.

\[Thus, although long-term HRV may lack the precision to disentangle sympathetic and parasympathetic activity due to overlapping behavioral and physiological influences, it may be a valuable tool for assessing autonomic responses in free-living conditions and informing lifestyle-based strategies to improve cardiovascular health. Hence, HRV show potential as a responsive marker to monitor successfullness in CVD risk management.\]
