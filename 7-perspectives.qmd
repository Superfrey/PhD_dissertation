We have discussed the mechanisms and clinical implications of cardiovascular autonomic function across different stages of glucose metabolism. Based on our findings and discussion, we propose further perspectives to define its role in research and healthcare from three aspects: (1) continuous non-invasive health monitoring, (2) risk stratification, and (3) identification as a causal and modifiable marker.

## Continuous monitoring of cardiovascular health

Wearable devices enables comprehensive data collection on behavioral (e.g., sleep and physical activity) and physiological (e.g., heart rate, ECG, temperature) parameters [@keshet2023]. These devices offer a broader and more feasible approach to long-term heart rate monitoring. Despite growing interest in wearable-based monitoring, the integration of HRV into routine cardiometabolic risk assessment remains limited.

Two key aspects highlight the potential applications of monitoring: (1) identification of risk and (2) assessment of response to intervention.

*Identification of risk*

Understanding when and how physiological signals reflect elevated CVD risk is essential for developing early and effective prevention strategies. In Study II, we observed that specific morning time points were associated with increased CVD risk, indicating that physiological responses captured under free-living conditions may provide meaningful insights into early risk detection. Rather than adjusting for physical activity as a confounding factor, future predictive models could benefit from integrating multiple physiological signals, including HRV, sleep, and activity patterns, to better reflect dynamic states of health. Machine learning techniques offer the ability to process complex raw time-series data, such as interbeat intervals and accelerometer signals, and to uncover patterns that may improve risk prediction beyond conventional summary measures of HRV. However, a key limitation of these models is their reduced explainability, which may limit their clinical applicability. Incorporating HRV into digital health platforms could support personalized feedback mechanisms, enabling timely lifestyle or therapeutic interventions and contributing to more adaptive and preventive healthcare strategies.

*Assessment of response to intervention*

HRV highlights a potential target for intervention, given that low HRV may be indicative of adverse lifestyle patterns. For instance, behavioral patterns such as disrupted sleep or irregular meal timing may influence circadian fluctuations in HRV. Evidence from studies on night-shift workers suggests that meal timing affects HRV, with daytime meals leading to higher HRV during night hours [@chellappa2025]. Medications de

Hence, future studies can leverage wearable devices to continuously monitor risk by HRV and better understand the behavioral factors and treatment options that contribute to its improvement or deterioration. This approach may help identify effective lifestyle patterns or medications that improve cardiovascular health through modulation of HRV. Hourly measures serves

However, standardization and transparency across different brands of wearable devices remain a challenge for both research and clinical implementation of heart rate and HRV monitoring. While smartwatches offer a convenient method for heart rate measurement, their accuracy can vary, as they rely on photoplethysmography to detect pulse rate at the wrist. This method can be imprecise under certain conditions, particularly during physical activity, due to motion artifacts and other external factors[@fuller2020]. Despite these limitations, ongoing improvements in sensor technology and algorithm calibration are likely to enhance the reliability of wearable-derived heart rate and HRV data.

## Risk-stratification

Individuals with elevated glucose levels are at increased risk of developing metabolic complications and CVD. However, many remain metabolically stable or even return to normal glucose regulation over time. As a result, structured treatment strategies for this group have not been widely adopted in clinical practice. This is partly due to the high degree of heterogeneity within this population. Therefore, additional indicators beyond glucose levels may be useful to identify those most likely to benefit from early intervention. 

Our findings suggest that HRV may serve as a valuable marker among individuals at elevated cardiovascular risk, helping to identify those who could benefit from targeted preventive strategies. Future research should evaluate whether individuals classified as high-risk based on autonomic dysfunction respond to specific interventions

In the context of wearable devices, it remains to be determined whether HRV can serve as an early indicator of CVD risk alongside simple markers such as age, sex, and BMI, and whether it may enable risk identification before more invasive measures, such as blood-based biomarkers, are considered.



A limitation of long-term HRV measurement is the lack of standardization, as data are collected under free-living conditions and may be influenced by daily behaviors, potentially affecting risk classification. Hence, standardized procedures may be needed. CART has been shown to be reliable non-invasive and typically takes approximately 10 minutes to complete. 


In Study III, we demonstrated a relationship between CAN and cardiac dysfunction, as measured by NT-proBNP. Heart failure is characterized by both structural and functional changes in the heart, such as left ventricular dysfunction, which can be assessed using echocardiography. However, the link between these structural and functional changes and their impact on systolic and diastolic pumping function in relation to CAN remains to be fully understood. Furthermore, the diagnostic and prognostic value of CAN, particularly its sensitivity and specificity in detecting HFrEF and HFpEF, requires further investigation.

## Effective causal modifiable marker

- clinical trails
- lifestyle intervention

Our findings in Studies I and II support the etiological link between long-term HRV and the risk of CVD, which provide a first line of evidence of a causal relationship. However, the observed association does not imply causation, and further research is necessary to determine whether the relationship between HRV and CVD risk is indeed causal. Traditionally, epidemiological research has relied on randomized controlled trials to establish causal relationships. However, conducting such trials to isolate the direct of HRV is particularly challenging. Interventions that modify HRV often do so indirectly, through changes in lifestyle factors such as weight loss, inflammation, or insulin sensitivity, or through pharmacological treatments like blood pressure medications. As a result, isolating the direct modification of HRV is difficult. To address these limitations, modern epidemiological approaches such as Mendelian randomization (MR)[@daveysmith2014] and structured causal mediation analysis offer promising alternatives for inferring causality from observational data \[modern epidemiology 4th edition\].

A genome-wide association study (GWAS) has identified 17 lead single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across eight loci associated with HRV based on short-term recordings, suggesting the potential for these variants to serve as genetic instruments in Mendelian randomization analyses [@nolte2017]. Another study demonstrated that phenotypically measured HRV was associated with all-cause mortality but found no evidence of a genetic association between genes linked to HRV and all-cause mortality [@tegegne2023]. To date, no GWAS has been conducted to investigate the genetic determinants of long-term HRV. Establishing such genetic associations is essential for understanding its genetic architecture and for providing unconfounded estimates by using genetic variants as proxies to assess the causal role of HRV in CVD.

A study have demonstrated that reduced HRV mediates the association between glomerular hyperfiltration and mortality [@chang2021a], indicating an initial potential for HRV as a modifying factor. While this has been shown in observational data, no evidence of such mediation has yet been established in trial data. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) showed that HRV may modify the effect of lifestyle intervention in preventing type 2 diabetes [@carnethon2006]. However, it remains unclear to what extent this modification applies to cardiovascular outcomes, and whether the intervention was more effective among individuals with lower HRV. Cardiometabolic intervention trials, whether focused on lifestyle modification or pharmacological treatment, should, where feasible, include HRV measurements to enable structured mediation analyses and to better understand the role of autonomic function in cardiovascular outcomes. This could help demonstrate whether modification of HRV through potential strategies such as medications like beta-blockers or lifestyle interventions including physical activity, diet, and sleep has a sustainable effect on CVD outcomes.

Earlier studies have shown an association between autonomic dysfunction, as measured by short-term HRV during rest, and arterial stiffness[@angelaberos2023]\[add cvd\]. In Study I, we extended perspective of but long-term HRV, does link with arterial stiffness, suggesting autonomic response to free-living conditions contribute to the development of arterial stiffness. In addition, we found that HRV was associated with locally measured carotid distensibility. However, our results are limited by the inability to distinguish between sympathetic and parasympathetic contributions to arterial stiffness, or to determine whether the observed risk is driven by specific responses to living conditions or circadian rhythm variations.

As increased sympathetic nervous system activity has been linked to greater plaque formation, and may be modifiable by reducing sympathetic drive, the autonomic nervous system could play a role in reducing atherosclerotic thrombus formation. However, more physiological studies are needed to understand the mechanisms of atherosclerosis in the presence of autonomic nervous dysfunction, including the causal direction between the two, and how this interplay may be altered during the progression from normal glucose metabolism to type 2 diabetes. This requires more precise measures of both sympathetic and parasympathetic activity, as well as markers of endothelial dysfunction, beyond what is currently captured by HRV and common indices of arterial stiffness.

[Thus, although long-term HRV may lack the precision to disentangle sympathetic and parasympathetic activity due to overlapping behavioral and physiological influences, it may be a valuable tool for assessing autonomic responses in free-living conditions and informing lifestyle-based strategies to improve cardiovascular health. Hence, HRV show potential as a responsive marker to monitor successfullness in CVD risk management.]
