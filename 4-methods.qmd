:::

#### Study I - The Maastricht Study

The Maastricht Study is a prospective observational population-based study of the general population of the province of Limburg, in the southern part of the Netherlands. The study emphasized the recruitment of individuals with T2D, through the regional Diabetes Patient Registry, to extensively phenotype individuals with T2D and those in intermediate stages of the disease. The eligibility criteria included an age range of 40–70 years. Participants were recruited through mass media campaigns and mailings from municipal registries (Gemeentelijke Basis Administratie; GBA).[@schram2014] In the analysis of Study I, the study among 7449 individuals included participants with measurements of 24-hour HRV and at least one measure of arterial stiffness (carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity or carotid artery distensibility), both of which were completed within a three-month period between November 2010 and December 2020. The study has been approved by the institutional medical ethics committee (NL31329.068.10) and the Minister of Health, Welfare and Sports of the Netherlands (Permit 131088-105234-PG). All participants gave written informed consent. [@schaarup2024]

#### Study II - ADDITION-PRO

The ADDITION-PRO study is a prospective, population-based cohort nested within the Danish arm of the ADDITION-Europe study. ADDITION was originally designed as a stepwise screening program for T2D in general practice, aiming to identify individuals with screen-detected T2D for recruitment into the ADDITION trial. ADDITION-PRO aims to investigate early markers of CVD and metabolic dysfunction in individuals in different tiers of diabetes risk.

The ADDITION-Europe screening program identified a large number of individuals with impaired fasting glucose (IFG), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), and normoglycemia despite having risk factors for diabetes and CVD. Participants for ADDITION-PRO were recruited from the original ADDITION-DK screening cohort, which included individuals from 190 general practices across Denmark. The recruitment strategy focused on individuals at high risk of diabetes without T2D, identified through a stepwise screening program that incorporated the Danish diabetes risk score from the Inter99 study[@christensen2004a]. This assessment, conducted between 2001 and 2006, considered factors such as age, sex, history of gestational diabetes, family history of diabetes, known hypertension, BMI, and physical activity. High-risk individuals were further screened for T2D using blood measurements, including HbA1c, random blood glucose, FPG, and OGTT. Those with screen-detected diabetes, confirmed by a second OGTT, were invited to participate in the ADDITION trial. High risk individuals without T2D were further considered in as the sampling frame for ADDITION-PRO.

Between 2009 and 2011, a follow-up health examination was conducted at four ADDITION-DK study centers to establish a cohort baseline. Eligible participants were those still alive, residing near the research centers (Steno Diabetes Center Copenhagen, Aarhus University Hospital, Holstebro Hospital, and the Hospital of South West Jutland, Esbjerg), and who had not withdrawn consent. Eligibility criteria included individuals aged 40–70 years who had previously undergone diabetes screening in ADDITION-DK. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy, psychological or psychiatric disorders preventing informed consent, and life-limiting conditions. One key feature of the data collection was the precise measurement of physical activity and energy expenditure using a combined chest worn accelerometer/heart rate monitor (ActiHeart), which recorded acceleration and heart rate over a week. In study II, participants with at least a 48-hour recording was included for the primary analysis, and then participants with hourly measures of physical acceleration during the hourly HRV recording was included in the second analysis. Participant with prior CVD ten years before inclusion was also excluded.

Disease history and follow-up data for the population were obtained from Denmark’s national registry system, which allows linkage of health records using the personal Civil Registration Number assigned to all citizens. The following national registries were accessed to collect information on incident CVD and mortality, medication use, and healthcare utilization: the National Patient Registry (hospital admissions and outpatient contacts), the National Health Service Registry (general practice visits), the Medical Prescription Registry, the Diabetes Registry, and the Cause of Death Registry.

#### Study III - CANCAN

The CANCAN Study is an observational study conducted at two hospital outpatient clinics in Viborg Regional Hospital and Regional Hospital Gødstrup. It aims to implement a screening protocol for identifying high-risk individuals using CAN assessments, continuous glucose monitoring, and heart failure indicators. All measures were part of routine clinical care for T2D in Central Denmark. We included 200 adults (\>18 years) with T2D with a duration of over one year. Exclusion criteria were recent laser-treated eye disease (≤3 months), pregnancy, lactation, life-threatening illness, or cognitive impairment preventing consent. Participants were identified via electronic records and informed about the study by their doctor during a telephone call. Those interested attended a dedicated meeting before their annual diabetes exam, where study details were discussed. Recruitment took place from 2021 to 2024. In study III, participants without a valid NT-proBNP measurement were excluded.

In study I-III different devices were used to capture the distance between each heartbeat defined as RR intervals from electrocardiogram traces either directly from heart-beat traces or indirectly from pulse traces. From this a sequence of successive heart beat intervals is extracted to calculate time- and frequency domain HRV.

*Time-domain indices*

Time-domain measures of HRV are based on the statistical distribution of normal-to-normal (NN) heartbeat intervals. Description of time-domain indices are summarized in @tbl-td.

*Frequency-domain indices*

Frequency-domain HRV indices are derived from sequences of NN intervals transformed into the spectral domain using Fourier transformation. These indices quantify heart rate oscillations over different timescales. Short-term variations, such as respiratory sinus arrhythmia, reflect rapid autonomic changes, while longer oscillations capture autonomic responses to posture changes, circadian rhythms, or other physiological processes. Description of frequency-domain indices are summarized in @tbl-fq.

**Holter recordings in study I**

All ECG recordings were obtained using a 12-lead Holter system (Fysiologic ECG Services, Amsterdam, the Netherlands) over 24 hours, as previously described.[@schram2014] Participants were instructed to follow their regular daily activities but avoid showering during the recording. The ECG data were processed using proprietary Holter Analysis Software (Fysiologic ECG Services), where artefacts and ectopic beats were excluded through automated processing and manual validation. A minimum recording duration of 18 hours was required for further analysis.[@schaarup2024][@coopmans2020] Inter-beat intervals between consecutive sinus beats were provided in milliseconds (ms). Time-domain HRV indices were calculated, including SDNN, SDANN, RMSSD, SDNN index, and pNN50. Frequency-domain measures were derived using Fast Fourier Transform, including TP, ULF, VLF, LF, and HF. [@schaarup2024]Outliers were removed. HRV indices were standardised by their mean and SD, and composite Z-scores were computed for time and frequency-domain measures, respectively. This selection of indices covers the main sources of HRV variance.[@schaarup2024]

**ActiHeart heart rate and physical activity in study II**

Heart rate was measured using a combined accelerometer and heart rate monitor (ActiHeart, CamNTech, Cambridge, UK), recording uniaxial acceleration and heart rate. The data collection and processing methods have been described previously. Mean heart rates were recorded in 30-second epochs. Based on a algorithm, distributions of interbeat-intervals was calculated in each 30-second epochs.[@schaarup2024a] HRV calculations were performed using the RHRV package (version 4.2.7) in R.[@schaarup2024a][@schaarup2024b] The algorithm was tested on a dataset with full access to all interbeat intervals.[@schaarup2024a] HRV indices based on global distribution in 24-hour recordings shown high validity.[@schaarup2024b] HRV indices including SDNN, SDANN, SDNN index, TINN, and mean heart rate (HR) were calculated by week, 24-hour cycle, and hour of the day, with hourly values averaged across recording days.[@schaarup2024b]

**Vagus device for cardiovascular autonomic reflex test in study III**

CAN was diagnosed using cardiovascular autonomic reflex tests (CARTs), the gold standard for CAN assessment. R-R intervals were derived from an ECG signal using the Vagus™ device (Medicus Engineering, Aarhus, Denmark.)[@hansen2025][@schaarup2025] We used pulse rate ratios measured under different conditions.[@schaarup2025] Three standardized cardiovascular autonomic reflex tests (CARTs) were performed: (1) lying-to-standing, (2) deep breathing, and the (3) Valsalva manoeuvre, following a standardized protocol conducted between 8:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m., after 10 minutes of supine rest.[@schaarup2025] Smoking and caffeine intake were prohibited two hours before testing. Each test was conducted once by trained examiners.[@schaarup2025]

Manifest CAN was defined as two or more abnormal CARTs using age-specific cut-off values.[@hansen2025] The Vagus™ device’s accuracy has been validated against FDA standards and stationary devices, showing moderate to high reproducibility[@fleischer2011]. Orthostatic hypertension was defined as a sustained drop in systolic blood pressure of ≥20 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure of ≥10 mmHg within three minutes of standing.[@schaarup2025]

### Confounders and variables for instrumental bias

Across Studies I, II, and III, a comprehensive set of covariates and potential confounders were assessed, including lifestyle factors, clinical measurements, biochemical markers, and socioeconomic indicators.[@schaarup2024; @schaarup2024b; @schaarup2025]

Smoking status was self-reported in all studies, categorized as never, former, or current (Study I), current/ex/never (Study II), and smoker/non-smoker (Study III). Alcohol consumption was recorded as average weekly units in all three studies.[@schaarup2024; @schaarup2024b; @schaarup2025] Physical activity was assessed via self-report in Studies I, II, III, with Study I capturing total and moderate-to-vigorous activity (hours/week), Study II used the Recent Physical Activity Questionnaire (RPAQ) to calculate physical activity energy expenditure (PAEE), and Study III classifying activity as sedentary or non-sedentary.[@schaarup2024; @schaarup2024b; @schaarup2025] In Study II also used combined accelerometry and heart rate monitoring (ActiHeart) to estimate PAEE.[@schaarup2024b] Study II included register-based data on socioeconomic status at baseline, including education length, income, and employment status.[@schaarup2024b] All studies included measurements of body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure, obtained during clinical examinations.[@schaarup2024; @schaarup2024b; @schaarup2025]

Blood samples were analyzed in all studies for HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), triglycerides, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol.[@schaarup2024; @schaarup2024b; @schaarup2025] Study I also included a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) to classify glucose metabolism status based on FPG and OGTT (normal, prediabetes, T2D) using WHO 2006 criteria, excluding HbA1c as a diagnostic criterion.[@schaarup2024] Study III additionally measured creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio.[@schaarup2025]

Self-reported history of CVD and use of anti-hypertensive, glucose-lowering, and lipid-lowering medications were collected in all studies.[@schaarup2024; @schaarup2024b; @schaarup2025] In Study II, history of CVD events in the 10 years prior to baseline were retrieved from national registers.[@schaarup2024b] In Study III, history of CVD was collected electronic patient records.[@schaarup2025]

## Outcomes

### Arterial stiffness

Arterial stiffness is characterized by arteriosclerosis and atherosclerosis properties of the arteries. The stiffness of different segments of the vascular musculature can be assessed both locally and dynamically. Aortic and carotid stiffness were assessed as markers of arterial stiffness, following previously described procedures.[@tanlaizhou2018]

**Pulse wave velocity**

Aortic stiffness was measured by carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cf-PWV) using applanation tonometry (SphygmoCor, Atcor Medical, Sydney, Australia), with the median of at least three consecutive recordings included in the analysis. cf-PWV is calculated based on the time between the ECG systole and the arrival of the pressure wave at the femoral and carotid measurement sites along with the distance between these two measurement sites. cf-PWV is measured with participants in a supine position following a 10-minute rest period. The aortic path length was determined using a tape measure by subtracting the carotid-to-sternal notch distance from the femoral-to-sternal notch distance.[@tanlaizhou2018]

**Carotid artery distensibility**

Carotid stiffness was assessed by the carotid artery distensibility coefficient (CD), based on ultrasound imaging of the left common carotid artery using a 7.5 MHz linear probe (MyLab 70, Esaote Europe, Maastricht, the Netherlands). CD was calculated as ΔD/braPP, where ΔD represents carotid distension and braPP is brachial pulse pressure. Mean heart rate and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were recorded every five minutes using an oscillometer device (Accutorr Plus, Datascope, Montvale, NJ, USA).[@tanlaizhou2018]

### Indicators of heart failure

N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) is a neuretic peptide that can be used to detect patients with heart failure and the progression of heart failure. It derives from B-type natriuretic peptid (BNP) which is a cardial neurohormone, that is synthesized and secreted as response to stretched cariomycytes and cardiac volume overload. After secretion, proBNP is cleaved, releasing the active hormone BNP along with the remaining N-terminal fragment, known as NT-proBNP. In Study III, a blood sample was taken at the study cite. Description of the NT-proBNP analysis of plasma samples is described in supplementary material in Appendix Study III.[@schaarup2025]

A modified version of the validated The WATCH-DM heart failure risk score was used. The risk score is based on 9 variables: two binary (history of myocardial infarction and coronary artery bypass grafting) and seven continuous (age, BMI, systolic/diastolic BP, serum creatinine, HDL cholesterol, and HbA1c). Scores range from 0–39, categorized as very low (≤11), low (12–13), moderate (14–15), high (16–18), and very high (≥19) risk.[@schaarup2025][@segar2022][@segar2019]

NYHA class stage I-IV was included. Heart failure symptoms were defined as NYHA class II–IV, assessed by a physician.[@schaarup2025]

### Cardiovascular events

Information on CVD events and mortality was obtained from the Danish National Patient Registers until 2021 by utilizing the ICD-10 codes for stroke, myocardial infarction, cardiovascular death, cardiovascular revascularization, and heart failure. We defined three-point major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) as myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiovascular revascularization, and cardiovascular death.[@schaarup2024b]

## Statistical Methods

### Cross-sectional analysis

*Study I*

In Study I, we used multiple linear regression to investigate associations between 24-hour HRV and arterial stiffness. Model 1 adjusted for age, sex, education, glucose metabolism status, and mean arterial pressure (MAP) to account for the oversampling of individuals with T2D and potential instrumental bias of arterial pressure flow. Model 2 included additional adjustments for smoking behavior, alcohol consumption, physical activity, body mass index, HbA1c, triglycerides, total-to-HDL cholesterol ratio, and medication use. Arterial stiffness measures were log-transformed to ensure normally distributed residuals and back-transformed into percentage change estimates. A sex interaction term was added to assess if the association differed between sex. We performed sensitivity analyses excluding individuals on antihypertensive treatment or glucose-lowering medication. [@schaarup2024]

*Study III*

In Study III, we applied logistic regression models to investigate the association between CAN and heart failure, using NT-proBNP as the primary outcome. We adjusted for age, sex, and diabetes duration, smoking behavior, alcohol consumption, body mass index, HbA1c, triglycerides, total cholesterol, and antihypertensive medication, eGFR and prior CVD. We performed sensitivity analyses and excluded participants with beta-blocker treatment or prior CVD. We applied logistic regression to assess the odds of CAN asoociation wtih heart failure symptoms, defined by a NYHA class II or higher, adjusting for covaties in primary analysis. Linear regression was employed to evaluate differences in the WATCH-DM risk score between individuals with and without CAN.[@schaarup2025]

### Time-to-event analysis

In Study II, we used Poisson regression models to quantify the associations between multiday HRV and cardiovascular events, as follow-up data were undisturbed over time and to avoid assumptions of proportional hazards[@whoneed2012]. Multiday HRV was modelled using splines with knots at predefined percentiles to assess non-linear associations. Hourly HRV was analysed separately for each hour to observe if the association of HRV had diurnal variation. Both HRV and mHR were standardized by their mean and standard deviation to ensure comparability. Based on assumptions about potential confounding pathways summarized in directed acyclic graphs (DAG), we fitted two models: Model 1 adjusted for age and sex, while Model 2 further adjusted for education, smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity (physical activity energy expenditure (PAEE) calculated from Recent Physical Activity Questionnaire RPAQ), body mass index, total cholesterol, and HbA1c. Additional analyses were performed with HRV pre-adjusted for concurrent heart rate and physical acceleration to account the influence of these factors. Missing covariates were handled using multiple imputation. Each individual's follow-up period began at the time of their inclusion in the baseline examination. [@schaarup2024b] To calculate age-specific incidence rate (IR) we did the following. Follow-up ended at the earliest occurrence of CVD, heart failure, all-cause mortality, death, or the end of the study period . The follow-up time was divided into one-year intervals based on the individual's age. Using this age-split data, incidence rates of CVD, heart failure, and all-cause mortality were analyzed in relation to the HRV, with age treated as a time-varying covariate in a Poisson regression model.

### Effect modification

Effect modification is used to assess whether the association between an exposure and an outcome varies depending on the level of a third variable, known as the effect modifier [@knol2012].

In Study I, it was hypothesized that the association between 24-hour and arterial stiffness was stronger in strata of progression of diabetes (normal glucose metabolism, prediabetes, T2D). Therefore, interaction term between HRV and diabetes status was included to observe the size of the association across strata.[@schaarup2024] We did subsidiary analysis in a subpopulation without T2D to check if the effect was modified by HbA1c. In Study II, the association between multiday HRV and CVD endpoints varied by sex was quantified, to explore potential biological dimorphism.[@schaarup2024b] In Study III, we aimed to determine whether the association between CAN and elevated NT-proBNP is present in the subgroup without symptoms, defined as NYHA class \< II. Hence, the hypothesis was no significant effect modification between groups with and without symptoms. Similarly, whether the association remains present in the group classified as low to moderate risk of heart failure was explored, based on the WATCH-DM risk score.[@schaarup2025]

A significant effect modification between the exposure and the effect modifier in all analyses was defined as an interaction term with a p-value \< 0.05.

### Multiple imputed by chained equations

Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE) is a method for handling missing data in datasets. This procedure imputes missing values through an iterative series of predictive models, generating plausible estimates while preserving the relationships within the data. To avoid one imputation for missing value could give the value the same confidence as the a non-missing value, Rubins Rule was followed. Rubin’s rules in MICE combine results from multiple imputed datasets by pooling estimates of interest (e.g., means or regression coefficients) using their within- and between-imputation variances[@harel2018]. Thus, we ensure valid statistical inferences by accounting for the uncertainty introduced by missing data.

In Study II, confounders was imputed to include as many participants and avoid excluding population with our without cardiovascular or mortality events. Dataset was imputed 10 times. In Study III, missing CART was imputed, as a proportion of participants had non-valid test due to insufficient air in the valsalva manuevre, unstable heart beats or data error. These variables was used as auxiliary variables in imputation to reduce bias [@hughes2019]. All available variables of biochemical measures, diagnosis, medication and cause of non-valid CART was used to impute each missing CART using predictive mean matching.[@schaarup2025]

### Instrumental bias

In Study I-III we are investigating the physiological properties by dynamic measures and biomarkers to quantify autonomic function, arterial stiffness, and cardiac function. Other conditions may affect the properties we are attempting to measure, and thus are causing instrumental bias.

*Vascular Stiffness*

In Study I, we used measurements of arterial stiffness using cf-PWV and carotid distensibilty. Both measures are influenced by arterial pressure at the time of examination. Arterial pressure affects the propagation of the pressure wave through the aorta (cf-PWV) and the expansion and contraction of the carotid artery (carotid distensibilty).[@kim2007] To account for this, we adjusted for mean arterial pressure in our models.[@schaarup2024]

*Cardiovascular autonomic function*

In Study II, we assessed autonomic function using multiday HRV recordings and hourly HRV measurements. Studies have highlighted that HRV is dependent on heart rate, and low HRV may simply reflect a higher resting heart rate (rHR). To adjust for this without overcorrecting for a collinear variable, we pre-adjusted HRV by regressing rHR on HRV, extracting the residuals, and using these as the pre-adjusted determinant. For hourly HRV, variability in heart rate may be influenced by changes in physical activity, creating a risk that HRV serves as a proxy for movement rather than autonomic function. To address this, we applied a similar pre-adjustment approach by regressing concurrent heart rate and physical acceleration to account for physical activity.[@schaarup2024b]

*Biomarker of Heart Failure*

In Study III, kidney function and overweight are know to influence NT-proBNP levels independently of heart failure[@heidenreich2022]. We adjusted the model to account for the blurred effect of eGFR on NT-proBNP levels in the analysis.[@schaarup2025]
