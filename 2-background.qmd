This background introduces the concept of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and its associated cardiovascular risk. It then provides an overview of various cardiovascular complications, including arteriosclerosis, atherosclerosis, and heart failure. Finally, it describes cardiovascular autonomic function (autonomic function) and its potential to enhance our understanding of CVD.

## Type 2 diabetes and prediabetes

The progression from normal glucose metabolism to T2D is characterized by sustained elevations in blood glucose levels. T2D is characterized by a progressive decline in beta-cell function, most often as a consequence of chronic insulin resistance [@tabák2012][@bonora2018]. Insulin resistance occurs when certain tissues, such as muscle and liver tissues, lose their sensitivity to insulin. As a result, glucose is not effectively taken up by these tissues and remains in the circulation. Meanwhile, beta-cell function deteriorates, leading to a diminished insulin response to glucose levels. Years before diagnosis, these changes contribute to rising fasting and postprandial glucose levels[@tabák2012].

The body regulates glucose through various mechanism. During fasting, pancreatic alpha cells secrete glucagon, which stimulates hepatic glucose production via glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. After a meal, rising blood glucose levels stimulate pancreatic beta cells to release insulin and trigger the secretion of incretins, such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) from the intestines. Insulin and incretins work together to suppress hepatic glucose production, while insulin promotes glucose uptake in muscle and adipose tissue. Excess glucose is primarily stored as glycogen in the liver and muscles, with some converted to triglycerides for long-term storage. Multiple organs, including the pancreas, liver, kidneys, intestines, muscle, and adipose tissue are involved in this coordinated process. The autonomic nervous system plays a supportive role in glucose homeostasis by modulating metabolic activity. Parasympathetic signals tend to reduce glucose production, while sympathetic signals enhance it, especially during hypoglycemia[@bonora2018].

Progression towards diabetes is a continuous process, with T2D defined based on glucose thresholds associated with an increased risk of diabetes-specific microvascular complications, particularly retinopathy. The World Health Organization (WHO) [@worldhealthorganization2020] and American Diabetes Association (ADA)[@americandiabetesassociationprofessionalpracticecommittee2021] diagnostic criteria for T2D include fasting plasma glucose ≥7.0 mmol/L, 2-hour plasma glucose ≥11.1 mmol/L during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), or hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) ≥6.5% (48 mmol/mol). The OGTT measures glucose levels two hours after the ingestion of a standard 75-gram glucose load in the fasting state. many complications of diabetes, such as macrovascular disease, neuropathy, cancer, and cognitive impairment, may start to develop at earlier stages of dysglycemia[@mokhtar2023][@huang2014][@stehouwer2018]. This stage is referred to as prediabetes or high risk of diabetes and is defined by fasting plasma glucose levels between 6.1–6.9 mmol/L, 2-hour plasma glucose levels between 7.8–11.0 mmol/L (WHO criteria), and HbA1c levels between 5.7–6.4% (39–47 mmol/mol) (ADA criteria)[@americandiabetesassociationprofessionalpracticecommittee2021]. In parallel with the growing prevalence of T2D, the prevalence of prediabetes is also on the rise[@rooney2023].

Risk factors for progression to T2D and its complications range from genetic predisposition to lifestyle and socio-environmental factors. The most common risk factors to diabetes is obesity, and in particular central obesity[@taylor2013]. The accumulation of diabetes risk factors is linked with a combination of adverse changes in cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, including increases in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, and systolic blood pressure, along with decreases in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol[@færch2013].

Diabetes increases the risk of both microvascular and macrovascular complications, which are major contributors to the morbidity and mortality associated with the disease[@bonora2018]. Beyond conventional CVD risk factors, chronic hyperglycemia promotes the formation of harmful byproducts such as reactive oxygen species and advanced glycation end products, which drive oxidative stress and inflammation[@ritchie2020]. These processes contribute to endothelial dysfunction and vascular damage[@ritchie2020]. While the general mechanisms underlying macrovascular complications are well described, the identification of preclinical stages of CVD and the differentiation of CVD risk between individuals at high risk of diabetes and those with established T2D require further clarification[@birkenfeld2024].

## Cardiovascular disease

Globally, CVD remains the leading cause of death. At the population level, CVD risk is primarily attributable to modifiable lifestyle behaviors such as chronic stress, physical inactivity, unhealthy diet, excessive alcohol consumption, and smoking, as well as socio-environmental factors like socio-economic status and air pollution [@yusuf2020]. At the individual level, these exposures often manifest through more proximal biological risk factors, including hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, and obesity. Along the causal pathway, these intermediate conditions tend to cluster, thereby accelerating disease progression. These processes are underpinned by biomolecular mechanisms, including local and systemic inflammation, oxidative stress involving oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and dysregulated immune responses mediated by pro-inflammatory cytokines and signaling pathways. Risk factors contribute to distinct pathophysiological mechanisms across different types of CVD, involving structural, signaling, inflammatory, and hemodynamic changes within the cardiovascular system. Among these, cellular and molecular signaling pathways play a central role in regulating vascular tone, cardiac function, and inflammatory responses. These processes are closely modulated by the autonomic nervous system through sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve branches.

### Arteriosclerosis

Emerging evidence emphasizes the role of vascular aging in early disease development, extending beyond the traditional focus on cardiovascular endpoints [@mitchell2020]. Arteriosclerosis, commonly referred to as arterial stiffness, is a hallmark of this process. Biologically, the medial layer of large arteries consists of a structured network of vascular smooth muscle cells together with elastic and collagen fibers, forming functional musculoelastic sheets[@lee2010]. Arterial stiffness arises from progressive remodeling of the arterial wall [@mitchell2020][@lu2023]. This remodeling is driven by changes in the structural interactions between elastin and collagen fibers, along with functional alterations in vascular smooth muscle cells and the accumulation of calcium and advanced glycation end products [@lee2010]. Remodeling of the arterial wall increases systolic blood pressure and reduces coronary perfusion, thereby contributing to the development of hypertension and, eventually, cardiovascular disease [@zhong2018]. Additionally, arterial stiffness elevate the pulsatile load on the microcirculation, promoting the progression of chronic kidney disease, vascular dementia, and Alzheimer’s disease[@mitchell2020].

### Atherosclerosis

Atherosclerosis is characterized by the accumulation of cholesterol, lipids, and other substances within the arterial walls, forming plaques that narrow the arteries and reduce blood flow (ref.) often at specific sites such as the coronary and carotid arteries. This chronic process can lead to progressive occlusion of the vessel, contributing to reduced oxygen supply to the heart (ref.), often leading to symptoms of angina.

Atherosclerotic plaques can be classified into stable and unstable types, each with distinct structural characteristics and clinical implications. Stable plaques typically have a thick fibrous cap composed of collagen, a small lipid core, and low levels of inflammation. These plaques are less likely to rupture and tend to remain intact over time due to internal remodeling. In contrast, unstable plaques, also known as vulnerable plaques, often contain a large lipid-rich necrotic core, a thin fibrous cap, and infiltration by inflammatory cells such as macrophages. A well-recognized subtype of unstable plaque is the thin-cap fibroatheroma, which is particularly prone to rupture. When rupture occurs, the necrotic core becomes exposed to the bloodstream, initiating the formation of a thrombus or blood clot. This acute event can abruptly obstruct the artery, resulting in myocardial infarction [@kawai2024]. Chronic ischemia due to reduced coronary perfusion can lead to myocardial remodeling, impaired contractility, and electrical instability, thereby increasing the risk of arrhythmias and heart failure[@alasady2013][@elgendy2019].

**Myocardial infarction**

Myocardial infarction occurs due to the rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque in the coronary arteries, triggering thrombus formation that blocks blood flow. This leads to oxygen deprivation (ischemia) and subsequent myocardial injury or necrosis. If untreated, this process can cause extensive cardiac damage and fatal arrhythmias. Over the past decades, the incidence of myocardial infarction has declined in high-income countries(ref.) with a marked reduction in MI-related mortality(ref.). These improvements are largely attributed to a combination of public health initiatives and medical advances. On the public health front, a substantial decrease in smoking prevalence has been the most important lifestyle-related factor contributing to the reduction in CVD [@bilano2015][@ockene1997]. Medically, the improved preventive management of hypertension and hyperlipidemia has reduced the burden of atherosclerotic disease. In acute care, the widespread adoption of evidence-based interventions such as thrombolytic therapy, percutaneous coronary interventions (including stenting), and coronary artery bypass grafting has improved survival and outcomes following MI. In T2D, the risk of MI is elevated by 72%, with an approximately threefold risk among patients under 60 years compared to age under 60 without T2D [@shah2015]. Similar to the general population, its incidence and fatality have declined among people with diabetes.

**Stroke**

The majority of strokes are ischemic and result from an obstruction in a cerebral artery. The process often begins with the development of atherosclerotic plaques at the carotid artery bifurcation, which can lead to the formation of emboli. These emboli then travel through the bloodstream and eventually lodge in the cerebral arterial tree, causing ischemic stroke. The second main cause is hemorrhagic stroke, which is characterized as a hypertensive small-vessel disease, leading to small lipohyalinotic aneurysms that subsequently rupture, causing intracerebral bleeding [@donnan2008]. Ischemic stroke remains one of the global leading contributors to mortality and disability [@vos2020]. The incidence, prevalence, and cause-specific mortality of stroke remain high but have stagnated, although some declines have been observed in high-income countries [@li2024]. Individuals with elevated glucose levels, as measured by fasting plasma glucose, OGTT, or HbA1c, have a 26% higher risk of stroke compared to those with normal glucose levels [@lee2012][@barr2007]. In T2D, the ischemic stroke risk is elevated almost two-fold compared with individuals without diabetes[@shah2015].

### Heart failure

Heart failure develops gradually with age and often accelerates with the progression of T2D. As prevention and treatment of CVD have improved survival in recent years, the prevalence of heart failure has increased, while the incidence remains stable, but may rise with aging populations[@khan2024].

It may arise as a consequence of atherosclerosis, arteriosclerosis, or both, contributing to myocardial ischemia, pressure overload, and structural cardiac changes. Heart failure can be defined hemodynamically as the inability to maintain adequate cardiac output at rest or during exertion, or the ability to do so only with elevated cardiac filling pressures. It is a complex cardiovascular disease caused by structural and functional changes in the heart musculature, affecting systolic and/or diastolic pumping function. Heart failure is generally classified into two subtypes: heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Both subtypes involve cardiac remodeling but are defined by left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). HFrEF is defined by an LVEF \< 40%, while HFpEF is characterized by an LVEF ≥ 50% along with structural or functional cardiac abnormalities, as assessed by echocardiography. HFrEF is often a consequence of repeated, non-fatal myocardial infarctions. These events can leave behind scar tissue in the myocardium, impairing the heart's ability to contract effectively and leading to progressive systolic dysfunction.

The most common feature of HFpEF is left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, caused by impaired relaxation and increased stiffness, leading to elevated left atrial pressure and reduced diastolic reserve [@normand2019]. Over the past decades, the prevalence of HFpEF has increased with an aging population and more people living with conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. It is diagnosed based on structural or functional abnormalities identified through echocardiographic measures, such as left ventricular hypertrophy, left atrial enlargement, or elevated filling pressures[@campbell2024]. The diagnosis may seem straightforward, but it is often challenging in community settings, as patients frequently present without typical heart failure symptoms (e.g., shortness of breath) and are not routinely assessed with biomarkers like N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) or brain-neuretic-peptide (BNP). As a result, HFpEF is commonly underdiagnosed and consequently detected at more severe stages, leading to hospitalization [@campbell2024].

## Cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction

The cardiovascular system is regulated by autonomic nervous system which influences heart rate and vasoconstrictuion through neurotransmitter release by the sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves. The primary neurotransmitter of the sympathetic nervous system is noradrenaline, while the parasympathetic nervous system primarily releases acetylcholine by stimulation through the Vagus nerve. Sympathetic activation increases heart rate and myocardial contractility by stimulating the sinoatrial (SA) node, atrioventricular (AV) node, and ventricular myocardium. In contrast, parasympathetic activation primarily reduces heart rate by directly modulating SA node activity through vagal stimulation. It also slows AV nodal conduction, predominantly via the left vagus nerve, thereby prolonging atrioventricular conduction time. Afferently nerves mainly carry sensory information (e.g., baroreceptor input from the carotid sinus and aortic arch) to the brain, which then adjusts efferent autonomic output to regulate arterial tone. Hence, the autonomic nervous system dynamically regulates heart rate and blood pressure to maintain homoeostasis in response to physiological demands, such as rest and physical activity.

In youth, the autonomic nervous system is highly adaptive and responsive to living conditions, maintaining autonomic balance. However, with aging, there is a gradual decline in parasympathetic function and an increase in sympathetic activity. Additionally, metabolic-related conditions such as obesity and diabetes have been shown to further contribute to cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction (autonomic dysfunction). Autonomic dysfunction reflects a stressed cardiometabolic environment, as both dysfunction in lipid and glucose metabolism are associated with increased sympathetic activity [@schlaich2015]. This dysfunction may result from cumulative neural damage mediated by mechanisms such as hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, and elevated levels of adipokines. At the same time, autonomic dysfunction is known to disrupt lipid and glucose metabolism [@schlaich2015]. Therefore, the relationship between autonomic dysfunction and cardiometabolic factors is likely a vicious cycle [@rinaldi2023]. The consequences can lead to autonomic dysfunction/neuropathy (CAN), resulting dysregulation in heart rate and vascular dynamics. In this dissertation, 'autonomic dysfunction' will be used as the broader term, while 'CAN' will refer specifically to autonomic dysfunction resulting from neuropathy in T2D.

Autonomic function can be assessed using heart rate variability (HRV) indices, which measure the variation in successive normal RR intervals in milliseconds. HRV provides time- and frequency-domain estimates of the balance between sympathetic and parasympathetic activity. High HRV reflects an autonomic nervous system with strong adaptability to the body’s demands, whereas low variation indicates poor adaptation to changing conditions. HRV changes in response to different physiological or environmental conditions (e.g., sleep, stress, posture, physical activity), and these changes can be observed in its natural 24-hour (diurnal) pattern [@natarajan2020]. Most studies have examined autonomic function using short-term ECG recordings at rest. However, extended HRV recordings across the circadian cycle may offer deeper insights into the influence of lower-frequency variability sources, such as very-low frequency (0.003–0.04 Hz) and ultra-low frequency (≤0.003 Hz)\[reflecting what\]. HRV has been applied across several research domains. For example, in psychology as a marker of mental stress, in exercise physiology as an indicator of recovery, in cardiovascular research as a marker of autonomic dysfunction due to cardiac complications, and in diabetes research as a marker of autonomic neuropathy(ref.,ref.ref.,ref.). T2D alters the expression of sympathetic bursts, as measured by resting muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA). MSNA is elevated in individuals with both T2D and hypertension, compared to those who are normotensive, regardless of whether they have diabetes or not[@huggett2003]. Parasympathetic activity is also impaired in individuals with high cardiometabolic risk and T2D, as reflected by reduced baroreflex sensitivity [@cseh2020] and lower HF and RMSSD short-term HRV. Before onset of diabetes and during progression of diabetes long-term (24-hour) HRV has shown to be lower compare to those with normal glucose metabolism [@rinaldi2023][@coopmans2020]. Cardiovascular autonomic reflex tests (CARTs) and orthostatic hypotension are considered the gold standard for assessing CAN[@hansen2025]. The diagnosis includes assessing pulse rate ratio under test conditions, such as the deep breathing test, the lying-to-standing test, and the Valsalva maneuver[@hansen2025]. Both HRV and CARTs have shown to be associated with cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and all-cause mortality, primarily in populations with T2D or established cardiovascular disease. However, it remains unclear at which stage in the progression of diabetes risk to pre-diabetes to diabetes these measures begin to influence the risk of cardiovascular complications.

## Risk-stratification

Current cardiopreventive guidelines place strong emphasis on prevent and treat T2D. The 2022 ADA/EASD guidelines for the management of hyperglycemia in T2D recommend, cardioprotective medication (GLP-1 receptor analogues and SGLT2-inhibitors) as first-line options for individuals at high cardiovascular risk. Due to their benefits in heart failure, SGLT2 inhibitors are specifically recommended for patients with documented HFrEF or HFpEF. High cardiovascular risk is defined as the presence of at least two risk factors at age \>55 years, such as obesity, hypertension, smoking, dyslipidemia, or albuminuria. However, no additional preclinical markers are recommended to identify individuals at higher CVD or HF risk. Despite their increased risk of cardiovascular complications, individuals at high risk of developing diabetes remain outside structured treatment options, even though diabetes risk and cardiometabolic markers can be successfully modified through lifestyle interventions and medication such as GLP-1 analogoues [@reductio2002][@kahn2024]. During the progression and following the onset of T2D, preclinical stages may be characterized by markers of elevated cardiovascular risk, highlighting the potential for early risk stratification. Risk stratification is the process of classifying or ranking individuals in increasing order of estimated risk, based on risk scores, biomarker levels, omic data (metabolomic, proteomics, and genomic) or preclinical conditions. This approach aids in identifying patients for prognostic or diagnostic purposes, identifying subgroups that require further evaluation, intensified treatment, or lifestyle modifications.

Autonomic dysfunction despite it’s relationship with cardiovascular complication has not been used in clinical practice. Larger epidemiological cohort studies encompassing various stages of diabetes risk, from normal glucose metabolism to prediabetes, onset of T2D, and longer term progression of T2D, serve as valuable resources for identifying risk-stratification opportunities. Epidemiological studies provide a broad representation of the target population, allowing understand the relationship between autonomic dysfunction and cardiovascular complications. They also have potential to determine when, along the trajectory of diabetes progression and duration, autonomic function are meaningful for cardiovascular risk-stratification.
