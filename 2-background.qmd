## Type 2 diabetes and prediabetes

The body regulates glucose and insulin to maintain glucose homeostasis. During fasting, pancreatic alpha cells secrete glucagon, which stimulates hepatic glucose production via glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. Meanwhile, glucose is endogenously produced by the liver and kidneys and utilized by body tissues. After a meal, rising blood glucose levels stimulate pancreatic beta cells to release insulin and trigger the secretion of incretins, such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) from the intestines. Insulin and incretins work together to suppress hepatic glucose production, while insulin promotes glucose uptake in muscle and adipose tissue. Excess glucose is primarily stored as glycogen in the liver and muscles, with some converted to triglycerides for long-term storage. Glucose homeostasis is dynamically regulated by inhibitory factors (insulin, hyperglycemia, parasympathetic activity, and substrate availability) and stimulatory factors (glucagon, counterregulatory hormones, hypoglycemia, sympathetic activity, and gluconeogenic substrates).

The progression from normal glucose metabolism to type 2 diabetes is characterized by sustained elevations in blood glucose levels, primarily driven by insulin resistance and followed by a gradual decline in beta-cell function. Insulin resistance occurs when certain cells, such as muscle and liver cells, lose their sensitivity to insulin. As a result, glucose is not effectively taken up by these tissues and remains in blood circulation. Meanwhile, beta-cell function deteriorates, leading to a diminished insulin response to glucose intake. Years before diagnosis, these changes contribute to rising fasting and postprandial glucose levels. \[note: read Omar introduction!!!\]

Diabetes progression is a continuum, with type 2 diabetes defined based on glucose thresholds associated with an increased risk of diabetes-specific microvascular complications, particularly retinopathy. The WHO (2011) and ADA (2015) diagnostic criteria for type 2 diabetes include fasting plasma glucose ≥7.0 mmol/L, 2-hour plasma glucose ≥11.1 mmol/L during an oral glucose tolerance test, or hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) ≥6.5% (48 mmol/mol). However, many complications of diabetes, such as macrovascular disease, neuropathy, cancer, and cognitive impairment, can begin to develop at earlier stages of dysglycemia. This stage is referred to as prediabetes or high risk of diabetes and is defined by fasting plasma glucose levels between 6.1–6.9 mmol/L, 2-hour plasma glucose levels between 7.8–11.0 mmol/L (WHO criteria), and HbA1c levels between 5.7–6.4% (39–47 mmol/mol) (ADA criteria) \[ref.\].

Risk factors for progression to type 2 diabetes and its complications range from genetic predisposition to lifestyle and socio-environmental factors. The most common precursor to diabetes is central obesity, characterized by excess body fat. The accumulation of diabetes risk factors is linked with a combination of adverse changes in cardiometabolic markers, including increases in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, body mass index (BMI), and systolic blood pressure, along with decreases in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. \[Lancet Diabetes Endocrinol 2013; 1: 43–51\].

Diabetes increases the risk of both microvascular and macrovascular complications, which are major determinants of the disease’s associated morbidity and mortality. Diabetes and cardiovascular disease share common risk factors, including lifestyle factors and conventional clinical markers. As individuals progress toward diabetes, their cardiovascular risk increases, making them more susceptible to developing cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, the identification of preclinical stages of CVD and how CVD risk differs among individuals at high risk of diabetes and individuals with type 2 diabetes needs further definition.

## Cardiovascular disease

Globally, CVD remains the leading cause of death. However, the main cause of mortality varies by country income levels, with cancer becoming the leading cause in some high-income countries. CVD risk is primarily attributable to modifiable lifestyle behaviour such as stress, sedentary behaviour, unhealthy diet, alcohol consumption, and smoking, as well as socio-environmental factors like socio-economic status and air pollution [@yusuf2020]. Along the causal pathway towards CVD, these risk factors contribute to comorbidities such as clinical obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia, further accelerating overall CVD risk. While risk factors are largely shared across CVD types, the mechanisms differs, involving structural, signalling, inflammatory, and dynamic changes in the cardiovascular system.

### Arteriosclerosis

Hard CVD end-points are the primary focus of CVD prevention measures. However earlier markers of arterial stiffness assess the gradual vascular pathology and reflect arteriosclerosis, atherosclerosis, vascular calcification. With aging, elastin fibers are gradually replaced by collagen fibers, leading to increased vascular stiffness [@lu2023]. Arterial stiffness is characterized by changes between collagen, elastin, and smooth muscle cells. Stiffening of the arterial vasculature increases systolic pressure, reduces coronary perfusion, and raises the pulsatile load on the micro- and macrocirculation. This process can be accelerated by modifiable CVD risk factors. The progression of arterial stiffness is an early marker in the trajectory of CVD development, as increased stiffness precedes rises in blood pressure and CVD.

### Atherosclerosis

Atherosclerosis is characterized by plaque build-up in the arteries, which can develop into a thrombus, leading to artery blockage or haemorrhage. The underlying process of atherosclerosis is where cholesterol, fat, and other substances accumulate in the arterial walls, causing narrowing and reducing blood flow to the heart. When the oxygen supply to the heart is insufficient, it can result in chest pain (angina) or, in severe cases, myocardial infarction. Over time, chronic ischemia can lead to structural and functional changes in the heart, increasing the risk of heart failure and arrhythmia.

**Myocardial infarction**

Myocardial infarction (MI) occurs due to the rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque in the coronary arteries, triggering thrombus formation that blocks blood flow. This leads to oxygen deprivation (ischemia) and subsequent myocardial injury or necrosis. If untreated, this process can cause extensive cardiac damage and fatal arrhythmias. Over the past decades, the incidence rate of MI has decreased in high-income countries, while improvements in early detection and treatment (both intravenous and therapeutic) have led to a steep decline in MI-related mortality. These advancements have also contributed to a lower prevalence of individuals living with prior MI. In type 2 diabetes, the risk of MI is elevated by 72%, with an approximately threefold risk among patients under 60 years compared to age under 60 without type 2 diabetes [@shah2015]. Similar to the general population, its incidence and fatality have declined in diabetes.

**Stroke**

Stroke is a cardiovascular disease that can be either ischemic or hemorrhagic. The majority of strokes are ischemic, caused by an obstruction in a cerebral artery, often due to an atherosclerotic plaque or embolism. The second main cause is hemorrhagic stroke, which is characterized as a hypertensive small-vessel disease, leading to small lipohyalinotic aneurysms that subsequently rupture, causing intracerebral bleeding and increased intracranial pressure [@donnan2008]. Ischemic stroke remains one of the global leading contributor to mortality and disability [@vos2020]. The incidence, prevalence, and cause-specific mortality of stroke remain high but have stagnated, although some declines have been observed in high-income countries [@li2024]. Stroke risk is already elevated at high levels of glucose (fasting plasma, OGTT, and HbA1c) among people in a pre-diabetic range where the the risk exceed of 26% higher risk compared to population without diabetes [@lee2012][@barr2007]. In type 2 diabetes, the ischemic stroke risk is elevated almost two-fold [@shah2015].

### Heart failure

Heart failure develops gradual with age and often accelerates with the progression of type 2 diabetes. As treatment of ischemic CVD events has improved survival over the last years, the incidence and prevalence of heart failure has increased. Therefore, early detection are important as heart failure leads to lower life-expectancy and quality of life.

Heart failure is commonly classified as either ischemic or non-ischemic in origin. It may arise as a consequence of atherosclerosis, arteriosclerosis, or both, contributing to myocardial ischemia, pressure overload, and structural cardiac changes. Heart failure is a clinical condition characterized by symptoms of breathlessness, fatigue, and fluid retention, often accompanied by clinical signs such as pulmonary crepitations, jugular venous elevation, and peripheral edema. Heart failure can also be defined hemodynamically as the inability to maintain adequate cardiac output at rest or during exertion, or the ability to do so only with elevated cardiac filling pressures. Therefore, it is a complex cardiovascular disease caused by structural and functional changes in the heart musculature, affecting systolic and/or diastolic pumping function. Heart failure is generally classified into two subtypes: heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Both subtypes involve cardiac remodeling but are defined by left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). HFrEF is characterized by an LVEF \<40%, while HFpEF is identified using various clinical criteria. HFrEF is often followed by ischemic caused heart failure.

The most common feature of HFpEF is left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, caused by impaired relaxation and increased stiffness, leading to elevated left atrial pressure and reduced diastolic reserve [@normand2019]. Over the past decades, the prevalence of HFpEF has increased with an aging population and more people living with conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. It is diagnosed based on abnormal echocardiographic measures of, e.g., left ventricular hypertrophy, left atrial enlargement, or elevated filling pressure [@campbell2024]. The diagnosis may seem straightforward, but it is often challenging in community settings, as patients frequently present without typical heart failure symptoms (e.g., shortness of breath) and are not routinely assessed with biomarkers like N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) or brain-neuretic-peptide (BNP). As a result, HFpEF is commonly underdiagnosed and consequently detected at more severe stages, leading to hospitalization [@campbell2024].

## Cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction

The cardiovascular system is regulated by autonomic nervous system which influences heart rate and vasoconstrictuion through neurotransmitter release by the sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves. The primary neurotransmitter of the sympathetic nervous system is noradrenaline, while the parasympathetic nervous system primarily releases acetylcholine by stimulation through the Vagus nerve. Sympathetic activation increases heart rate and myocardial contractility by stimulating the sinoatrial (SA) node, atrioventricular (AV) node, and ventricular myocardium. In contrast, parasympathetic activation primarily reduces heart rate by directly modulating SA node activity through vagal stimulation. It also slows AV nodal conduction, predominantly via the left vagus nerve, thereby prolonging atrioventricular conduction time. Afferently nerves mainly carry sensory information (e.g., baroreceptor input from the carotid sinus and aortic arch) to the brain, which then adjusts efferent autonomic output to regulate arterial tone. Hence, the autonomic nervous system dynamically regulates heart rate and blood pressure to maintain homoeostasis in response to physiological demands, such as rest and physical activity.

In youth, the autonomic nervous system is highly adaptive and responsive to living conditions, maintaining autonomic balance. However, with aging, there is a gradual decline in parasympathetic function and an increase in sympathetic activity. Additionally, metabolic-related conditions such as obesity and diabetes have been shown to further contribute to autonomic dysfunction. Autonomic dysfunction reflects a stressed cardiometabolic environment, as both dysfunction in lipid and glucose metabolism are associated with increased sympathetic activity [@schlaich2015]. This dysfunction may result from cumulative neural damage mediated by mechanisms such as hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, and elevated levels of adipokines. At the same time, autonomic dysfunction is known to disrupt lipid and glucose metabolism [@schlaich2015]. Therefore, the relationship between autonomic dysfunction and cardiometabolic factors is likely a vicious cycle [@rinaldi2023]. The consequences can lead to cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction/neuropathy (CAN), resulting dysregulation in heart rate and vascular dynamics.

Cardiovascular autonomic function can be assessed using heart rate variability (HRV) indices, which measure the variation in successive normal RR intervals in milliseconds. HRV provides time- and frequency-domain estimates of the balance between sympathetic and parasympathetic activity. High HRV reflects an autonomic nervous system with strong adaptability to the body’s demands, whereas low variation indicates poor adaptation to changing conditions. HRV changes in response to different physiological or environmental conditions (e.g., sleep, stress, posture, physical activity), and these changes can be observed in its natural 24-hour (diurnal) pattern [@natarajan2020]. Most studies have examined cardiovascular autonomic function using short-term ECG recordings at rest. However, extended HRV recordings across the circadian cycle may offer deeper insights into the influence of lower-frequency variability sources, such as very-low frequency (0.003–0.04 Hz) and ultra-low frequency (≤0.003 Hz). Hear rate variability \[from excercises physiology to psychology, to cardiovascular research, to diabetes research\]. Type 2 diabetes has shown to significantly modify the expression of sympathetic bursts, measured by resting muscle sympathetic nerve activity, and even higher when co-exiting with hypertension compared to normotensive without diabetes [@huggett2003]. Parasympathetic activity is as well deteriorated among high cardiometabolic risk, and type 2 diabetes, shown by impaired baroreflex sensivity [@cseh2020] and lower HF and RMSSD short-term HRV. Before onset of diabetes and during progression of diabetes long-term (24-hour) HRV has shown to be lower compare to those with normal glucose metabolism [@rinaldi2023][@coopmans2020]. Cardiovascular autonomic reflex tests (CARTs) are considered the gold standard for assessing CAN. The diagnosis includes assessing pulse rate ratio under test conditions, such as the deep breathing test, the lying-to-standing test, and the Valsalva maneuver. Both HRV and CARTs have been associated with cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and all-cause mortality, primarily in populations with type 2 diabetes or established cardiovascular disease. However, it remains unclear at which stage in the progression of diabetes risk to pre-diabetes to diabetes these measures begin to influence the risk of cardiovascular complications.

## Risk-stratification

Current cardiopreventive guidelines place strong emphasis on type 2 diabetes. The 2022 ADA/EASD guidelines for the management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes recommend, cardioprotective medication GLP-1 receptor agonists and SGLT2-inhibitors as first-line options for individuals at high cardiovascular risk. Due to their benefits in heart failure, SGLT2 inhibitors are specifically recommended for patients with documented HFrEF or HFpEF. High cardiovascular risk is defined as the presence of at least two risk factors at age \>55 years, such as obesity, hypertension, smoking, dyslipidemia, or albuminuria. However, no additional preclinical markers are recommended to identify individuals at higher CVD or HF risk. Despite their increased risk of cardiovascular complications, individuals at high risk of developing diabetes remain outside structured treatment options, even though diabetes risk and cardiometabolic markers can be successfully modified through lifestyle interventions and medication such as GLP-1 analogoues [@reductio2002][@kahn2024]. During the progression and after the onset of type 2 diabetes, preclinical stages may manifest with markers of higher cardiovascular risk, underscoring the potential for risk stratification. Risk stratification is the process of classifying individuals based on risk scores, biomarker levels, omic data (metabolomic, proteomics, and genomic) or preclinical conditions. This approach aids in subtyping patients for prognostic or diagnostic purposes, identifying subgroups that require further evaluation, intensified treatment, or lifestyle modifications.

Cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction despite it's relationship with cardiovascular complication has not been defined into clinical practice. Larger epidemiological cohort studies encompassing various stages of diabetes risk, from normal glucose metabolism to prediabetes, onset of type 2 diabetes, and longer term progression of type 2 diabetes, serve as valuable resources for identifying risk-stratification opportunities. Epidemiological studies provide a broad representation of the target population, allowing understand the relationship between cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction and cardiovascular complications. They also have potential to determine when, along the trajectory of diabetes progression and duration, autonomic function are meaningful for cardiovascular risk-stratification.

## Aetiological research

Aetiology seeks to identify the causes and contributing factors of disease, forming the foundation for understanding its development and underlying mechanisms. Ideally, to determine causal effects, we would compare outcomes in individuals who were exposed to a risk factor with what would have happened if they had not been exposed. Since this counterfactual scenario is impossible to observe directly, we rely on study designs, such as randomized controlled trials when feasible, and apply statistical methods to data from observational cohort studies to approximate these comparisons. In cardiovascular disease, socio-environmental influences and personal health behaviours play a crucial role in overall health and are considered the outer contributing layer to biological mechanism. The inner layer focuses on biological causal processes, where the connection between these contributing factors and individual predisposition to cardiovascular disease remains a key question in understanding the underlying pathological mechanisms.

Cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction is linked to CVD and all-cause mortality. However, many questions remain regarding the underlying causal mechanisms. Furthermore, as dysglycemia is known to be a primary driver of autonomic dysfunction [@jeffreyj.goldberger2019], the questions is to which extent it modulates the relationship between cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction and CVD? This relationship remains unclear, highlighting the need for a deeper understanding of this interplay in target populations representing different stages of glucose metabolism.
