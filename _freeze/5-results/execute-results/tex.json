Among the time-domain indices, SDNN, SDNNi, and SDANN showed the strongest associations, with cf-PWV being lower by 2.5% (CI: 2.0; 3.1), 2.5% (CI: 1.9; 3.4), and 2.2% (CI: 1.7; 2.7), respectively. Conversely, CD was higher by 3.2% (CI: 1.7; 4.7), 3.0 % (CI: 1.4; 4.6), and 2.8% (CI: 1.3; 4.3), respectively. RMSSD and pNN50 showed a weaker association with cf-PWV (-1.1% \\[CI: -1.4; -0.4\\], and -1.1 \\[-1.7; -0.6\\]), while no evidence for an association was found with CD.\n\n**Frequency-domain HRV**\n\nIn the fully adjusted model 2, PWV was 2.8% (CI: 2.1; 3.5) lower, while CD was 3.2% (CI: 1.3; 5.1) higher per SD increase in HRV frequency-domain Z-score. Among the frequency-domain indices, total power, VLF, and ULF showed the strongest associations, with cf-PWV being lower by 2.2% (CI: 1.7; 2.8 ), 2.4% (CI: 1.9; 4.0), and 2.1% (CI: 1.5; 2.6), respectively. Conversely, CD was higher by 2.7% (CI: 1.2; 4.2), 2.4% (CI: 0.9; 4.1), and 2.6% (CI: 1.1; 4.1), respectively. HF showed a weaker association with cf-PWV (-0.9% \\[CI: -1.4; -0.4\\]), while no evidence for an association was found with CD. Mean interbeat interval was associated with 2.4 % (CI: 1.8; 2.9) lower cf-PWV and 4.5% (3.1; 6.1) higher CD.\n\n### Effect modification of diabetes status\n\nThe study population represented diabetes risk of normal glucose metabolism (65%), prediabetes (15%), and type 2 diabetes (20%). The median (IQR) cf-PWV (aortic stiffness) increased with diabetes status: NGM: 8.08 m/s (7.28, 9.16), prediabetes: 8.96 m/s (7.84, 10.32), and type 2 diabetes: 9.36 m/s (8.16, 10.80). CD (carotid stiffness) decreased: NGM: 15.0 (11.8, 18.8), prediabetes: 13.5 (10.4, 16.9), and type 2 diabetes: 12.5 (9.9, 16.0) × 10⁻³/kPa. SDNN (ms) was highest in NGM and decreased with worsening glucose metabolism: NGM: 138ms (117, 164), prediabetes: 127ms (106, 152), and type 2 diabetes: 116ms (96, 139).\n\nThe association between HRV time-domain Z-scores and cf-PWV and CD was significantly modified by prediabetes (PWV: -4.9 \\[CI: -6.523; -3.243\\] $^{interaction(*) ^{p-value< 0.01}}$ CD: 8.0 \\[CI:3.8; 12.5\\]$^{*^{p-value< 0.01}}$) but not by type 2 diabetes (PWV: -3.5 % \\[CI: -4.8; -2.1)\\] $^{*^{p-value< 0.1}}$ CD: 4.8 % \\[CI:1.3; 8.4\\]$^{*^{p-value< 0.1}}$). For the indices SDNN and SDANN, the association with both cf-PWV and CD was significantly modified by both prediabetes and type 2 diabetes.\n\nThe association between HRV frequency-domain Z-score and cf-PWV was significantly modified from normal glucose metabolism by prediabetes (-5.7 %\\[CI:-7.4; -3.9\\]$^{*^{p-value< 0.01}}$) and type 2 diabetes (-3.9 %\\[CI:-5.4; -2.3\\]$^{*^{p-value< 0.05}}$) while CD was only modified by prediabetes (8.3 %\\[CI:3.6; 13.2\\]$^{*^{p-value< 0.01}}$) but not by type 2 diabetes (5.3 %\\[CI:1.4; 9.4\\]$^{*^{p-value< 0.1}}$). For the indices total power and ULF, the association with both cf-PWV and CD was significantly modified by both prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. Mean inter beat interval association with cf-PWV or CD was not significantly modified by diabetes status.\n\nPrototypical individuals representing diabetes risk from normal glucose metabolism, to prediabetes to type 2 diabetes \\[edit text from manuscript about comparison between 95th percentile and 5th percentile\\] showed to have xx% higher PWV and xx% lowed CD. Among people with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes the difference was xx% higher PWV and xx% lowed CD and xx% higher PWV and xx% lowed CD, respectively.\n\n\\[Different risk % higher by diabetes status (NGT, prediabetes, T2D)\\]\n\n\\[FPG and Hba1c values and the interaction and the magnitude of the association between HR and AS\\]\n\n## Study II\n\n### Descriptive\n\nIn ADDITION-PRO population consisted of 1,627 participant with a least 48-hour HRV measures, while 1,432 had all hour represented with hourly HRV and physical acceleration. The study population included different tiers of diabetes risk: 154 individuals at low risk (9%), 889 at high risk (51%), 314 with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) (18%), 226 with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) (13%), and 161 with both IFG and IGT (9%). We splitted SDNN into categories by very-low (SDNN\\< 100 ms), low (SDNN 100-120 ms), middle (SDNN 121-140 ms), high (SDNN 141-160 ms) and very-high (SDNN \\>160 ms).\n\n\\[Higher age (68 years (6.3)), BMI (28.2 kg/m\\^2 (4.7)), HbA1c (5.9 % (0.6)), triglyceride (1.4 (0.8)), and higher proportion of men (63%), and users of anti-hypertensive medication (60%) was observed among participants who experienced MACE or heart failure compared to participants without any CVD\\] replace with SDNN distribution\\] .\n\n### Week-long HRV and MACE, heart failure, and all-cause mortality.\n\nThe mean week-long SDNN was 139.0 (32.3) ms, and the mean heart rate was 73.5 (9.1) bpm. In the fully adjusted model, SDNN per SD was associated with a lower incidence rate ratio (IRR) for MACE 0.82 (CI: 0.69; 0.97), heart failure 0.76 (CI: 0.58; 0.99), and mortality rate ratio of 0.79 (CI: 0.66; 0.94). When we included knots in the model, the trends indicated that the risk increased when SDNN fell below 120-110 ms (approximately below 20th percentile), suggesting a potential cut-off point for higher risk. We therefore calculate incidence rate with SDNN levels at 100 ms, 120ms, and 160 ms, respectively, and plotted by a function of age.\n\n\\[Incedence rate curves\\]\n\n### Hourly HRV and MACE, heart failure, and all-cause mortality.\n\nFrom the hourly recordings, we observed a clear periodicity in SDNN, mean heart rate (HR), sleep patterns, and physical acceleration. SDNN increased from 5–6 AM, peaking at 8–9 AM \\[mean (SD)\\], followed by a gradual decline, reaching its lowest point around 1 AM the next day \\[mean SDNN (SD)\\]. A similar circadian pattern was observed in heart rate, though its peak occurred two hour later at 10–11 AM. After peaking, heart rate remained stable throughout the afternoon before gradually decreasing.\n\n\\[include results from hourly results\\]\n\n## Study III\n\n### Descriptive\n\nIn study III, 179 participants with type 2 had measures of NT-proBNP and performed the CART test. CAN was present in 30% (n = 54) of participants (36% among those with valid CAN measurements). Meanwhile, 24% (n = 43) were unable to complete the CART assessment adequately, primarily due to irregular heart rhythms (n = 8) or insufficient air pressure during the Valsalva manoeuvre (n = 21). Compare to those without CAN, the participants with CAN were more women (41 % vs 33 %), were more sedentary (45% vs 36%), had a higher proportion with prior major CVD (41% vs 20%) and declined eGFR (\\< 60) (36% vs 22%), higher levels of triglyceride (median 2.05 mmol/L vs 1.95 mmol/ L), were slightly older (median 62 years vs 61 years), had longer duration of type 2 diabetes (median 19 years vs 15 years), and higher use SGTL2-inhibitors (65% vs 60%) but lower use of GLP-1 RA (63% vs 70%). No other difference in clinical characteristic was observed.\n\n### Relationship between CAN and elevated NT-proBNP\n\nA greater proportion of individuals with CAN exhibited elevated NT-proBNP levels (\\>125 pg/ml) (51.9%, n=52/78) compared to those without CAN (23.2%, n=26/112). The fully adjusted odds ratio (OR) for elevated NT-proBNP in individuals with CAN was 5.69 (95% CI: 1.95, 18.49) relative to those without CAN. Among the cardiovascular autonomic reflex tests (CART), the Valsalva maneuver demonstrated the strongest association with NT-proBNP (OR 9.00, 95% CI: 2.88, 33.09; n=51/75), followed by deep breathing (OR 3.30, 95% CI: 1.17, 9.77; n=33/133) and orthostatic hypertension (OR 4.04, 95% CI: 1.27, 13.77; n=24/146). No significant association was identified for the lying-to-standing test (OR 0.80, 95% CI: 0.32, 1.97; n=54/108). After imputing missing CART data, the OR for CAN in relation to elevated NT-proBNP declined to 2.94 (95% CI: 1.37, 6.56). Sensitivity analyses, which excluded participants using beta-blockers or those with a history of CVD, resulted in a smaller sample size and wider confidence intervals, though the overall association remained unchanged.\n",
