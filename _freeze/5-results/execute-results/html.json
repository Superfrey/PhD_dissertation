Study population included 3673 participants. The study population represented diabetes risk of NGM (65%), prediabetes (15%), and T2D (20%). The median (IQR) cf-PWV (aortic stiffness) became higher with diabetes status: NGM: 8.08 m/s (7.28, 9.16), prediabetes: 8.96 m/s (7.84, 10.32), and T2D: 9.36 m/s (8.16, 10.80). CD (carotid stiffness) decreased: NGM: 15.0 (11.8, 18.8), prediabetes: 13.5 (10.4, 16.9), and T2D: 12.5 (9.9, 16.0) × 10⁻³/kPa. SDNN (ms) was highest in NGM and lowered with worsening glucose metabolism: NGM: 138ms (117, 164), prediabetes: 127ms (106, 152), and T2D: 116ms (96, 139). Further description of characteristics by diabetes are described in @tbl-ms.\n\n\\newgeometry{top=2cm, bottom=2cm, inner=0.2cm, outer=0.2cm}\n\n\n::: {#tbl-ms .cell tbl-cap='Study charteristics in The

Among the frequency-domain indices, total power, VLF, and ULF showed the strongest associations, with cf-PWV being lower by 2.2% (CI: 1.7; 2.8 ), 2.4% (CI: 1.9; 4.0), and 2.1% (CI: 1.5; 2.6), respectively.[@schaarup2024] Conversely, CD was higher by 2.7% (CI: 1.2; 4.2), 2.4% (CI: 0.9; 4.1), and 2.6% (CI: 1.1; 4.1), respectively.

For the indices SDNN and SDANN, the association with both cf-PWV and CD was significantly modified by both prediabetes and T2D[@schaarup2024].\n\nThe association between HRV frequency-domain Z-score and cf-PWV was statistically significant modified from NGM by prediabetes (-5.7 %\\[CI:-7.4; -3.9\\]$^{*^{p-value< 0.01}}$) and T2D (-3.9 %\\[CI:-5.4; -2.3\\]$^{*^{p-value< 0.05}}$) while CD was only modified by prediabetes (8.3 %\\[CI:3.6; 13.2\\]$^{*^{p-value< 0.01}}$) but not by T2D (5.3 %\\[CI:1.4; 9.4\\]$^{*^{p-value< 0.1}}$)[@schaarup2024]. For the indices total power and ULF, the association with both cf-PWV and CD was statistically significant modified by both prediabetes and T2D. Mean inter beat interval association with cf-PWV or CD was not significantly modified by diabetes status[@schaarup2024].\n\nAs no stepwise increase was observed in the modification of glucose metabolism status from prediabetes to T2D,the subgroup with T2D was excluded to test whether the association was gradually modified by dysglycemia. In this subgroup, the association between HRV time and frequency-domain Z-scores and measures of arterial stiffness was modified by HbA1c (range of interaction p-values: 0.1 to 0.005) (see Figure @fig-MS-HRV_dys). For example, per SD lower HRV frequency domain Z-score at HbA1c 6.4% was associated with a 5.4% higher (CI: 3.5; 7.2) cf-PWV, which was 2.0% to 4.0% higher compared to the magnitude of association at HbA1c levels of 5.6% and 4.8% (see see @fig-MS-HRV_dys B). In CD, per SD lower HRV frequency domain Z-score at HbA1c 6.4% was associated with an 8.1% lower (CI: -13.5; -2.9) CD, which was 4.8% to 9.5% lower compared to the magnitude of association at HbA1c levels of 5.6% and 4.8% (see @fig-MS-HRV_dys D).

The IR was observed to become higher with age, reaching its peak at age 72. For heart failure at age 65, the IR was 20.5 (CI: 15.3; 27.5) at SDNN = 100 ms, slightly higher than at SDNN = 120 ms (IR: 19.6 \\[CI: 14.8; 25.9\\]) and SDNN = 160 ms (IR: 19.8 \\[CI: 15.0; 26.2\\]) (@fig-addprohrv B). The IR remained stable until age 70, after which it became higher. For all-cause mortality at age 65, the IR was 11.6 (CI: 6.3; 21.4) at SDNN = 100 ms, higher than at SDNN = 120 ms (IR: 7.6 \\[CI: 4.3; 13.3\\]) and SDNN = 160 ms (IR: 6.0 \\[CI: 3.4; 10.4\\]) (@fig-addprohrv C).\n\n### Hourly HRV and MACE, heart failure, and all-cause mortality.\n\nFrom the hourly recordings, a clear periodicity in SDNN, heart rate, sleep patterns, and physical acceleration was observed (see Figure S4 in supplemental material Appendix Study II). Mean (SD) SDNN was found to increase from 5–6 AM (70.2 \\[28.8\\] ms), peaking at 8–9 AM (92.1 \\[29.0\\] ms), followed by a gradual decline, reaching its lowest point around 2 AM the next day (64.1 \\[28.1\\] ms).[@schaarup2024b] A similar circadian pattern was observed in heart rate, although its peak was reached two hours later, starting at 9 AM (76.7 \\[10.9\\] bpm).[@schaarup2024b] After peaking, heart rate was observed to remain stable throughout the afternoon before gradually decreasing.[@schaarup2024b]\n\nIn @fig-ADD_PRO_risk_by_hour, hourly SDNN (preadjusted for heart rate and physical acceleration), heart rate, and physical acceleration associations were examined. Models were adjusted for age, sex, education, alcohol consumption, smoking behavior, BMI, total cholesterol, and HbA1c. The morning response of SDNN was found to be most indicative of MACE, with the strongest association observed from 6–7 AM (IRR: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.71–1.00 per SD higher SDNN) (see @fig-ADD_PRO_risk_by_hour A).[@schaarup2024b] Heart rate between 12 AM and 6 AM showed a small trend toward higher risk of MACE (IRR range: 1.11 to 1.15 per SD higher heart rate), although none of the confidence intervals exceeded one (see @fig-ADD_PRO_risk_by_hour D).[@schaarup2024b] Across all hours, a plausible association between SDNN and heart failure was observed. However, this association disappeared after adjustment for physical acceleration and heart rate (see @fig-ADD_PRO_risk_by_hour B).[@schaarup2024b] In contrast, heart rate between 10 PM and 9 AM was associated with heart failure (IRR range: 1.37 to 1.58 per SD higher heart rate) (see @fig-ADD_PRO_risk_by_hour E). SDNN was consistently associated with all-cause mortality across all hours, with a stronger inverse association observed between 12 PM and 1 AM (IRR range: 0.79 to 0.88 per SD higher SDNN) (see @fig-ADD_PRO_risk_by_hour C).[@schaarup2024b] No clear trends of association were observed between heart rate and all-cause mortality.[@schaarup2024b]\n\n\n```{=tex}\n\\blandscape\n\\newgeometry{top=2cm, bottom=2cm, inner=0.5cm, outer=0.5cm}\n```\n\n::: {#fig-ADD_PRO_risk_by_hour .landscape fig-cap=\"**Diurnal heart rate variability and heart rate association with major adverse cardiovascular events, heart failure, and all-cause mortality risk**\" fig-align=\"center\" fig-width=\"\\\\textwidth\"}\n![](images/figure_ADD_PRO_risk_by_hour.png)\n\n*SDNN preadjusted for concurrent physical acceleration and heart rate, as well as mean heart rate (HR) and physical acceleration, were measured hourly from 00:00 to 24:00.
