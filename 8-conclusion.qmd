Autonomic dysfunction, assessed through 24-hour HRV, is associated with increased arterial stiffness. This relationship is already present in individuals with normal glucose metabolism and becomes stronger in stages of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. In people at high risk of diabetes, lower long-term HRV over a week has been linked to ischemic events, heart failure, and all-cause mortality, highlighting HRV as an important marker of cardiovascular health. Both HRV and heart rate exhibit circadian patterns in relation to cardiovascular events, with higher nighttime heart rate associated with increased risk of heart failure and specific time-of-day patterns linked to ischemic events. These findings suggest that both long-term and hourly HRV measures provide valuable prognostic information. Further studies are needed to determine whether modifying these measures can yield sustained preventive effects on cardiovascular disease and mortality, thereby clarifying the clinical role of HRV. Structured testing of cardiovascular autonomic function in people with type 2 diabetes may help identify those with CAN, who are at higher risk of heart failure. Notably, non-completion of the test itself may also indicate elevated risk, but becomes are a challenge for clinical implementation. Studies of echocardiographic measures can ascertain the link between CAN and risk of subtypes of heart failure.

Structured studies assessing screening strategies and trial designs, whether focused on lifestyle interventions or targeted pharmacological modulation of HRV, are needed to clarify the clinical role of HRV and CART in CVD prevention. Long-term HRV and its hourly fluctuations provide insight into autonomic responses under free-living conditions, while CARTs offer a standardized approach for diagnosing cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction. Future research should carefully select and integrate these measures to determine whether assessments of autonomic function can serve as targets for monitoring treatment and lifestyle effectiveness, or as indicators to guide stratified decisions for further cardiovascular assessment or intervention.

We ascertain the association between HRV and cardiovascular complications. However, the mechanism remains unclearâ€”whether autonomic dysfunction, measured by low HRV, is an indicator of developing ateriosclerosis, atheroma, cardiac remodeling, or a precursor for their development. While pathogenic pathways leading to CVD risk are similar across glucose metabolism, dysglycemais deterioration likely amplifies the effect of autonomic dysfunction on cardiovascular risk. Does lower HRV in people with dysglycemia indicate a different underlying physiological mechanism than in people with normal glucose metabolism?
