Autonomic dysfunction, assessed through 24-hour HRV, is associated with increased arterial stiffness. This relationship is already evident in individuals with normal glucose metabolism and becomes more pronounced in those with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. In individuals at high risk of type 2 diabetes, lower long-term HRV measured over a week has been linked to ischemic events, heart failure, and all-cause mortality, highlighting HRV's potential as a marker of cardiovascular health. Both HRV and heart rate follow circadian patterns in relation to cardiovascular events. Higher nighttime heart rate is associated with increased risk of heart failure, and specific morning patterns of HRV have been linked to ischemic events. These findings suggest that both long-term and hourly HRV measures provide valuable prognostic information. Structured testing of cardiovascular autonomic function in individuals with type 2 diabetes can detect those with CAN and may help identify individuals at higher risk of heart failure.

We have established an association between HRV and cardiovascular complications. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. It is not yet known whether autonomic dysfunction, as indicated by low HRV, is a marker of developing arteriosclerosis, atheroma, or cardiac remodeling, or whether it plays a causal role in their development. While the pathogenic pathways leading to cardiovascular risk appear similar across the spectrum of glucose metabolism, dysglycemia may amplify the impact of autonomic dysfunction. Whether lower long-term HRV in individuals with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes reflects a distinct physiological mechanism involving neuropathy, compared to those with normal glucose metabolism, remains an open question. When using HRV and standardized CART, it is important to carefully consider how the data are applied in relation to the specific research objectives, ranging from physiological mechanisms to clinical diagnosis.

Structured studies assessing screening strategies and trial designs, whether focused on lifestyle interventions or targeted pharmacological modulation of HRV, are needed to clarify the clinical role of HRV and CART in cardiovascular prevention. Long-term HRV and its hourly fluctuations provide insight into autonomic responses under free-living conditions. Further research is needed to determine whether modifying these measures can yield sustained preventive effects on cardiovascular disease and mortality. CARTs offer a standardized approach for diagnosing CAN. Clarifying the clinical utility of CARTs in assessing cardiovascular and heart failure risk through the identification of CAN is essential for advancing precision care in individuals with type 2 diabetes. Echocardiographic studies can help establish the link between CAN and the risk of specific heart failure subtypes. Future research should carefully select HRV measures aligned with specific clinical or research objectives. Long-term HRV and CART have demonstrated potential in cardiovascular risk assessment and should be integrated to evaluate whether autonomic function assessments can monitor treatment or lifestyle effectiveness, or guide stratified cardiovascular risk decisions in individuals with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes.
