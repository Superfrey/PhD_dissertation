This dissertation aimed to investigate whether cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction, assessed by heart rate variability and cardiovascular autonomic reflex tests, is associated with cardiovascular complications across different stages of glucose metabolism. The findings support the hypothesis that cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction is an early and independent marker of cardiovascular risk.

Across three studies, cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction was associated with increased arterial stiffness, a higher incidence of ischemic cardiovascular events, heart failure, and all-cause mortality. These associations were observed not only in individuals with T2D but also in those with prediabetes and normal glucose metabolism. This suggests that cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction may precede the development of overt metabolic disease. Furthermore, standardized cardiovascular autonomic reflex tests identified individuals with T2D who were at increased risk of heart failure, even when they were asymptomatic and not classified as high risk by conventional clinical tools.

In summary, cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction appears to be a clinically relevant marker of cardiovascular risk across the full spectrum of glucose metabolism. However, it remains unclear whether this dysfunction plays a causal role or reflects underlying pathophysiological processes. Further research is needed to determine its clinical utility in risk stratification and its potential as a target for intervention.

Autonomic dysfunction, assessed through 24-hour HRV, is associated with increased arterial stiffness. This relationship is already evident in individuals with normal glucose metabolism and becomes more pronounced in those with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. In individuals at high risk of type 2 diabetes, lower long-term HRV measured over a week has been linked to ischemic events, heart failure, and all-cause mortality, highlighting HRV's potential as a marker of cardiovascular health. Both HRV and heart rate follow circadian patterns in relation to cardiovascular disease. Higher nighttime heart rate is associated with increased risk of heart failure, and specific morning patterns of HRV have been linked to ischemic events. These findings suggest that both long-term and hourly heart rate and HRV measures provide valuable prognostic information. Structured testing of cardiovascular autonomic function in individuals with type 2 diabetes can detect those with CAN and may help identify individuals at higher risk of heart failure.

We have established an association between HRV and cardiovascular complications. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. It is not yet known whether autonomic dysfunction, as indicated by low HRV, is a marker of developing arteriosclerosis, atheroma, or cardiac remodeling, or whether it plays a causal role in their development. While the pathogenic pathways leading to cardiovascular risk appear similar across the spectrum of glucose metabolism, dysglycemia may amplify the impact of autonomic dysfunction. Whether lower long-term HRV in individuals with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes reflects a distinct physiological mechanism involving neuropathy, compared to those with normal glucose metabolism, remains an open question.

Structured studies assessing screening strategies may help determine the optimal timing, population, and methods for incorporating HRV and CART into clinical practice. Furthermore, trial designs that focus on either lifestyle interventions or targeted pharmacological modulation of HRV are needed to clarify the clinical role of HRV and CART in cardiovascular prevention. When using HRV and standardized CART, it is important to carefully consider how the data are applied in relation to specific research objectives, ranging from physiological mechanisms to clinical diagnosis. Long-term HRV and its hourly fluctuations provide insight into autonomic responses under free-living conditions. Further research is needed to determine whether modifying these measures can yield sustained preventive effects on cardiovascular disease and mortality.

CARTs offer a standardized approach for diagnosing CAN. Clarifying the clinical utility of CARTs in assessing cardiovascular and heart failure risk through the identification of CAN is essential for advancing precision care in individuals with type 2 diabetes. Echocardiographic studies can help establish the link between CAN and the risk of specific heart failure subtypes. Future research should carefully select HRV measures aligned with specific clinical or research objectives. Long-term HRV and CART have demonstrated potential in cardiovascular risk assessment and should be integrated to evaluate whether autonomic function assessments can monitor treatment or lifestyle effectiveness or guide stratified cardiovascular risk decisions in individuals with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes.
