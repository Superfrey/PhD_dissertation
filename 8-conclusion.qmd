This dissertation aimed to investigate how cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction, assessed by 24-hour HRV and CARTs, is associated with cardiovascular complications across different stages of glucose metabolism. The findings support the hypothesis that cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction is an early and independent marker of cardiovascular risk.

Cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction was associated with higher arterial stiffness not only in individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D), but also in those with prediabetes and normal glucose metabolism. A particularly pronounced association was observed in individuals with prediabetes, where lower multiday HRV was leading to an higher risk of cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and mortality. These findings suggest that cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction may contribute to cardiovascular complications even before the onset of T2D, potentially through a modifying effect during the early stages of dysglycemia. In populations with T2D, standardized CARTS identified individuals with CAN who were had higher  risk of heart failure, even when they were asymptomatic and not classified as high risk by conventional clinical tools.

Early detection are important as CVD and heart failure leads to lower life-expectancy and quality of life. This disserations demostrates cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction potential as s clinically relevant marker of cardiovascular risk across the full spectrum of glucose metabolism, even in stages before onset of T2D. However, it remains unclear whether this dysfunction plays a causal role or reflects underlying pathophysiological processes. Further research is needed to determine its clinical utility in risk stratification and its potential as a target for intervention.
