Autonomic dysfunction, assessed through 24-hour HRV, is associated with increased arterial stiffness. This relationship is already evident in individuals with normal glucose metabolism and becomes more pronounced in stages of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. In people at high risk of diabetes, lower long-term HRV over a week has been linked to ischemic events, heart failure, and all-cause mortality, highlighting HRV's potential as a marker of cardiovascular health. Both HRV and heart rate exhibit circadian patterns in relation to cardiovascular events, with higher nighttime heart rate associated with increased risk of heart failure and specific time-of-day patterns linked to ischemic events. These findings suggest that both long-term and hourly HRV measures provide valuable prognostic information. Structured testing of cardiovascular autonomic function in people with type 2 diabetes can detect those with CAN and may help identify individuals at higher risk of heart failure.

We have established an association between HRV and cardiovascular complications. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear, whether autonomic dysfunction, as indicated by low HRV, is a marker of developing arteriosclerosis, atheroma, or cardiac remodeling, or a precursor to their development. While pathogenic pathways leading to CVD risk appear similar across the spectrum of glucose metabolism, dysglycemia may amplify the impact of autonomic dysfunction on cardiovascular risk. Whether lower long-term HRV in individuals with dysglycemia reflects a distinct physiological mechanism involving neuropathy, compared to those with normal glucose metabolism, remains an open question.

Structured studies assessing screening strategies and trial designs, whether focused on lifestyle interventions or targeted pharmacological modulation of HRV, are needed to clarify the clinical role of HRV and CART in CVD prevention. Long-term HRV and its hourly fluctuations provide insight into autonomic responses under free-living conditions. Further research is needed to determine whether modifying these measures can yield sustained preventive effects on cardiovascular disease and mortality. CARTs offer a standardized approach for diagnosing CAN. Clarifying the clinical utility of CARTs in identifying patients with CAN is essential for advancing personalized care in type 2 diabetes. Echocardiographic studies can help establish the link between CAN and the risk of specific heart failure subtypes. Future research should carefully select HRV measures aligned with specific clinical or research objectives. Long-term HRV and CART should be integrated to evaluate whether autonomic function assessments can monitor treatment or lifestyle effectiveness or guide stratified cardiovascular risk decisions in people with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes.
