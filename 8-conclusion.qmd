Autonomic dysfunction, based on 24-hour heart rate variability, is link with higher arterial stiffness. The association was present in people with normal glucose metabolism and becomes stronger with progression to prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. In people with high risk of diabetes, long-term HRV over a week was associated with ischemic events, heart failure and all-cause mortality, demonstrating that heart rate variability related to cardiovascular health. HRV and heart rate showed circadian patterns in ischemic events and heart failure, presenting higher risk of heart failure at higher levels of heart rate during the night and higher risk of ischemic events. Hence, both long-term measurement and hourly measures conveys information about risk at are needed to  whether modification of long-term or hourly measures can have sustained preventive effect on cardiovascular disease and mortality to elucidate the role of HRV.

Autonomic dysfunction, assessed through 24-hour HRV, is associated with increased arterial stiffness. This relationship is already present in individuals with normal glucose metabolism and becomes stronger in stages of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. In people at high risk of diabetes, lower long-term HRV over a week has been linked to ischemic events, heart failure, and all-cause mortalityâ€”highlighting HRV as an important marker of cardiovascular health. Both HRV and heart rate exhibit circadian patterns in relation to cardiovascular events, with higher nighttime heart rate associated with increased risk of heart failure and specific time-of-day patterns linked to ischemic events. These findings suggest that both long-term and hourly HRV measures provide valuable prognostic information. Further studies are needed to determine whether modifying these measures can yield sustained preventive effects on cardiovascular disease and mortality, thereby clarifying the clinical role of HRV. 	Structured testing of cardiovascular autonomic function in people with type 2 diabetes may help identify those with CAN, who are at higher risk of heart failure. Notably, non-completion of the test itself may also indicate elevated risk.

Autonomic dysfunction is associated with cardiovascular complications across all stages of glucose metabolism; however, causality has yet to be established. Structured studies assessing screening strategies and trial design (either lifestyle or target medication of HRV) are needed to clarify their clinical role in CVD prevention, whether as targets for monitoring treatment and lifestyle success, or as indicators that guide stratified decisions for further cardiovascular assessment or intervention.

Structured studies assessing screening strategies and trial designs, whether focused on lifestyle interventions or targeted pharmacological modulation of HRV, are needed to clarify the clinical role of HRV in CVD prevention. HRV may serve as a target for monitoring treatment and lifestyle effectiveness or as an indicator to guide stratified decisions for further cardiovascular assessment or intervention.
