Denne afhandling undersøgte, om kardiovaskulær autonom dysfunktion er
forbundet med kardiovaskulære komplikationer hos personer med normal
glukosemetabolisme, prædiabetes og type 2-diabetes. Kardiovaskulær
autonom dysfunktion blev målt igennme hjeretrymevariabilitet (HRV) og
standardiserede kardiovaskulære autonome refleksundersøgelser (CARTs).
Blandt målingerne gav 24-timers HRV indsigt i den autonome balance og
døgnrytmens skift mellem sympatisk og parasympatisk aktivitet. Lavere
værdier var konsekvent forbundet med ugunstige kardiovaskulære udfald.

På tværs af tre studier blev autonom dysfunktion forbundet med højere
niveauer af arteriel stivhed, en højere forekomst af iskæmiske
hjertekarsygedom, hjertesvigt og dødelighed. Sammenhængen med arteriel
stivhed blev observeret på tværs af hele spektret af glukosemetabolisme
og var særligt forhøjet hos personer med prædiabetes, hvilket antyder,
at autonom dysfunktion. På baggrund af dette fokuserede det
efterfølgende studie på personer med høj risiko for at udvikle diabetes.
I denne population var kardiovaskulær autonom dysfunktion forbundet med
højere risiko for kardiovaskulær sygdom, hjertesvigt og dødelighed.

Kardiovaskulær autonom neuropati, defineret gennem abnormale CARTs, var
forbundet med en højere risiko for hjertesvigt hos individer med type 2
diabetes, selv hos personer uden symptomer. Disse fund tyder på, at
kardiovaskulær autonom dysfunktion kan fungere som en tidlig og
uafhængig markør for risikoen for hjertesvigt, især i populationer med
risiko for type 2-diabetes.

Afhandlingen konkluderer, at kardiovaskulær autonom dysfunktion er en
klinisk relevant risikofaktor, som bør tiltrække større opmærksomhed i
både forskning og klinisk praksis. Fremtidige studier bør undersøge, om
forbedring af autonom funktion kan reducere kardiovaskulær risiko, og om
målinger af autonom dysfunktion kan integreres i eksisterende
risikomodeller. Derudover er potentialet i smarture til kontinuerlig
overvågning og tidlig opsporing en mulighed, der kan vurderes i både
kliniske og generelle populationer.

\markboth{Summary}{Summary}

This dissertation investigated whether cardiovascular autonomic
dysfunction is associated with cardiovascular complications in
individuals with normal glucose metabolism, prediabetes, and type 2
diabetes. Cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction was assessed using heart
rate variability and standardized cardiovascular autonomic reflex tests.
Among the measures, 24-hour heart rate variability reflected autonomic
balance and circadian shifts in sympathetic and parasympathetic
activity. Lower long-term heart rate variability was consistently
associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes.

Across three studies, autonomic dysfunction was linked to higher levels
of arterial stiffness, a higher incidence of ischemic cardiovascular
events, heart failure, and all-cause mortality. The association with
arterial stiffness was observed across the full spectrum of glucose
metabolism and was particularly pronounced in individuals with
prediabetes, suggesting that autonomic dysfunction may play a role early
in the pathophysiological process. Building on this, the subsequent
studies focused on individuals at high risk of developing diabetes. In
this population, cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction was associated
with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and
mortality.

Cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy, as identified through abnormal
cardiovascular reflex testing, was associated with a higher risk of
heart failure, even in individuals without symptoms. These findings
suggest that cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction may serve as an early
and independent marker of heart failure risk, particularly in
populations at risk of type 2 diabetes.

The dissertation concludes that cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction is
a clinically relevant risk factor that warrants further attention in
both research and clinical practice. Future studies should explore
whether improving autonomic function can reduce cardiovascular risk and
whether measures of autonomic dysfunction can be integrated into
existing risk models. Additionally, the potential of wearable
technologies for continuous monitoring and early detection is a
possibility to be evaluated in both clinical and general populations.

\hypertarget{introduction}{%
\chapter{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

Diabetes mellitus is a growing global health concern, posing pressing
challenges for public health systems\textsuperscript{1}. As prevalence
rises, more individuals are exposed to an increased risk of premature
mortality and cardiovascular disease (CVD)\textsuperscript{1}. At the
same time, people live longer with diabetes, and therfore endure
extended periods under the burden of diabetes-related
complications\textsuperscript{2}. Despite advancements in cardiovascular
care, many complications are still detected at more advanced stages.
These include coronary artery disease, often identified through ischemia
or major CVD events and symptomatic heart failure. Early detection of
CVD risk and asymptomatic heart failure, such as increased atheroma
burden or subclinical heart failure, is
desirable{[}\textsuperscript{3}{]}\textsuperscript{4}.

Over the last decades, cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction has
repeatedly gained attention as a risk factor for CVD\textsuperscript{5}.
Heart rate variability (HRV) is considered a reliable marker for
measuring autonomic function, as it reflects the balance between
sympathetic and parasympathetic modulation of heart rate
intervals\textsuperscript{6}. Despite its recognition as a CVD risk
factor, cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction has not been implemented in
healthcare practice. In diabetes, lower HRV is regarded as an early
indicator of cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN), which is
diagnosed using cardiovascular autonomic reflex tests
(CARTs)\textsuperscript{7}. Signs of autonomic dysfunction, may already
be present in individuals with prediabetes\textsuperscript{8}.Despite
rising prevalence and increased CVD risk, people with prediabetes often
remain outside structured treatment pathways
{[}\textsuperscript{9}{]}\textsuperscript{10}. Although diabetes
contributes to autonomic dysfunction, it is still unclear at what stage
in the diabetes risk spectrum HRV and CARTs become clinically useful for
assessing CVD risk.

In the past, measuring HRV needed special instruments like an
electrocardiogram. Today, it's easy to track HRV with everyday devices
like smartwatches{[}\textsuperscript{11}{]}\textsuperscript{12}. This
increased accessibility allows for continuous monitoring and a better
understanding of HRV over extended periods and under various free-living
conditions\textsuperscript{13}. However, long-term HRV patterns and
specific diurnal responses in relation to cardiovascular complications
remain less well understood.

The overall aim of this dissertation is to understand how cardiovascular
autonomic dysfunction/CAN affects cardiovascular disease risk
(i.e.~heart failure, stroke, myocardial infarction) and specific
subclinical markers of CVD: carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity and
carotid artery distensibility in populations covering the whole glycemic
continuum, from healthy glucose metabolism to type 2 diabetes.

\chapter{Background}\label{background}}

This background introduces the concept of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and its
associated cardiovascular risk. It then provides an overview of various
cardiovascular complications, including arteriosclerosis,
atherosclerosis, and heart failure. Finally, it describes cardiovascular
autonomic function and its potential to enhance our understanding of
CVD.

\hypertarget{type-2-diabetes-and-prediabetes}{%
\section{Type 2 diabetes and
prediabetes}\label{type-2-diabetes-and-prediabetes}}

The progression from normal glucose metabolism to T2D is characterized
by sustained elevations in blood glucose levels. T2D is characterized by
a progressive decline in beta-cell function, most often as a consequence
of chronic insulin resistance
{[}\textsuperscript{14}{]}\textsuperscript{15}. Insulin resistance
occurs when certain tissues, such as muscle and liver tissues, lose
their sensitivity to insulin. As a result, glucose is not effectively
taken up by these tissues and remains in the blood circulation.
Meanwhile, beta-cell function deteriorates, leading to a diminished
insulin response to glucose intake. Years before diagnosis, these
changes contribute to rising fasting and postprandial glucose
levels\textsuperscript{14}.

The body regulates glucose through various mechanism to maintain glucose
homeostasis. During fasting, pancreatic alpha cells secrete glucagon,
which stimulates hepatic glucose production via glycogenolysis and
gluconeogenesis. Meanwhile, glucose is endogenously produced by the
liver and kidneys and utilized by body tissues. After a meal, rising
blood glucose levels stimulate pancreatic beta cells to release insulin
and trigger the secretion of incretins, such as glucagon-like peptide-1
(GLP-1) from the intestines. Insulin and incretins work together to
suppress hepatic glucose production, while insulin promotes glucose
uptake in muscle and adipose tissue. Excess glucose is primarily stored
as glycogen in the liver and muscles, with some converted to
triglycerides for long-term storage. Multiple organs, including the
pancreas, liver, kidneys, intestines, muscle, and adipose tissue are
involved in this coordinated process. The autonomic nervous system plays
a supportive role in glucose homeostasis by modulating metabolic
activity. Parasympathetic signals tend to reduce glucose production,
while sympathetic signals enhance it, especially during
hypoglycemia\textsuperscript{15}.

Diabetes progression is a continuous process, with T2D defined based on
glucose thresholds associated with an increased risk of
diabetes-specific microvascular complications, particularly retinopathy.
The World Health Organization (WHO)\textsuperscript{16} and American
Diabetes Association (ADA)\textsuperscript{17} diagnostic criteria for
T2D include fasting plasma glucose ≥7.0 mmol/L, 2-hour plasma glucose
≥11.1 mmol/L during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), or hemoglobin
A1c (HbA1c) ≥6.5\% (48 mmol/mol). OGTT is defined by measuring glucose
levels two hours after the ingestion of a standard 75-gram glucose load.
Diabetes progression is a continuum, with T2D defined based on glucose
thresholds associated with an increased risk of diabetes-specific
microvascular complications, particularly retinopathy. However, many
complications of diabetes, such as macrovascular disease, neuropathy,
cancer, and cognitive impairment, may develop at earlier stages of
dysglycemia{[}\textsuperscript{18}{]}\textsuperscript{19}\textsuperscript{20}.
This stage is referred to as prediabetes or high risk of diabetes and is
defined by fasting plasma glucose levels between 6.1--6.9 mmol/L, 2-hour
plasma glucose levels between 7.8--11.0 mmol/L (WHO criteria), and HbA1c
levels between 5.7--6.4\% (39--47 mmol/mol) (ADA
criteria)\textsuperscript{17}. In parallel with the growing prevalence
of T2D, the prevalence of prediabetes is also on the
rise\textsuperscript{9}.

Risk factors for progression to T2D and its complications range from
genetic predisposition to lifestyle and socio-environmental factors. The
most common precursor to diabetes is central obesity, characterized by
excess body fat\textsuperscript{21}. The accumulation of diabetes risk
factors is linked with a combination of adverse changes in
cardiometabolic markers, including increases in low-density lipoprotein
(LDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, body mass index (BMI), and systolic
blood pressure, along with decreases in high-density lipoprotein (HDL)
cholesterol\textsuperscript{22}.

Diabetes increases the risk of both microvascular and macrovascular
complications, which are major contributors to the morbidity and
mortality associated with the disease\textsuperscript{15}. Diabetes and
cardiovascular disease (CVD) share common risk factors, including
obesity, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia, as well as
lifestyle-related factors. Beyond these, chronic hyperglycemia promotes
the formation of harmful byproducts such as reactive oxygen species and
advanced glycation end products, which drive oxidative stress and
inflammation\textsuperscript{23}. These processes contribute to
endothelial dysfunction and vascular damage\textsuperscript{23}. As
individuals progress toward diabetes, their cardiovascular risk
increases, making them more susceptible to developing
CVD\textsuperscript{22}. However, the identification of preclinical
stages of CVD and how CVD risk differs among individuals at high risk of
diabetes and individuals with T2D needs further definition.

\hypertarget{cardiovascular-disease}{%
\section{Cardiovascular disease}\label{cardiovascular-disease}}

Globally, CVD remains the leading cause of death. At the population
level, CVD risk is primarily attributable to modifiable lifestyle
behaviors such as chronic stress, physical inactivity, unhealthy diet,
excessive alcohol consumption, and smoking, as well as
socio-environmental factors like socio-economic status and air
pollution\textsuperscript{24}. At the individual level, these exposures
often manifest through more proximal biological risk factors, including
hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, and obesity, which elevate
the likelihood of developing CVD. Along the causal pathway, these
intermediate conditions act as comorbidities that accelerate disease
progression. These processes are underpinned by biomolecular mechanisms,
including local and systemic inflammation, oxidative stress involving
oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and dysregulated immune
responses mediated by pro-inflammatory cytokines and signaling pathways.
Risk factors across different types of CVD contribute to distinct
pathophysiological mechanisms, involving structural, signaling,
inflammatory, and hemodynamic changes within the cardiovascular system.
Among these, cellular and molecular signaling pathways play a central
role in regulating vascular tone, cardiac function, and inflammatory
responses. These processes are closely modulated by the autonomic
nervous system through sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve branches.

\hypertarget{arteriosclerosis}{%
\subsection{Arteriosclerosis}\label{arteriosclerosis}}

Hard CVD endpoints remain the primary focus of prevention strategies,
emerging evidence emphasize the importance of vascular aging in early
disease development\textsuperscript{25}. Arteriosclerosis, commonly
referred to as arterial stiffness, is a hallmark of this process.
Biologically, the medial layer of large arteries consists of a
structured network of vascular smooth muscle cells together with elastic
and collagen fibers, forming functional musculoelastic
sheets\textsuperscript{26}. Arterial stiffness arises from progressive
remodeling of the arterial wall
{[}\textsuperscript{25}{]}\textsuperscript{27}. This remodeling is
driven by changes in the structural interactions between elastin and
collagen fibers, along with functional alterations in vascular smooth
muscle cells and the accumulation of calcium and advanced glycation end
products\textsuperscript{26}. Remodeling of the arterial wall increases
systolic blood pressure and reduces coronary perfusion, thereby
contributing to the development of hypertension and, eventually,
cardiovascular disease\textsuperscript{28}. Additionally, they elevate
the pulsatile load on the microcirculation, promoting the progression of
chronic kidney disease, vascular dementia, and Alzheimer's
disease\textsuperscript{25}.

\hypertarget{atherosclerosis}{%
\subsection{Atherosclerosis}\label{atherosclerosis}}

Atherosclerosis is characterized by the accumulation of cholesterol,
lipids, and other substances within the arterial walls, forming plaques
that narrow the arteries and reduce blood flow (ref.). This chronic
process can lead to progressive occlusion of the vessel, contributing to
reduced oxygen supply to the heart (ref.).

Atherosclerotic plaques can be classified into stable and unstable
types, each with distinct structural characteristics and clinical
implications. Stable plaques typically have a thick fibrous cap composed
of collagen, a small lipid core, and low levels of inflammation. These
plaques are less likely to rupture and tend to remain intact over time
due to internal remodeling. In contrast, unstable plaques, also known as
vulnerable plaques, often contain a large lipid-rich necrotic core, a
thin fibrous cap, and infiltration by inflammatory cells such as
macrophages. A well-recognized subtype of unstable plaque is the
thin-cap fibroatheroma, which is particularly prone to rupture. When
rupture occurs, the necrotic core becomes exposed to the bloodstream,
initiating the formation of a thrombus or blood clot. This acute event
can abruptly obstruct the artery, resulting in myocardial infarction. In
some cases, fragments of the thrombus may dislodge and travel further
along the arterial tree, leading to thromboembolic complications such as
stroke or peripheral ischemia\textsuperscript{29}. Chronic ischemia due
to reduced coronary perfusion can lead to myocardial remodeling,
impaired contractility, and electrical instability, thereby increasing
the risk of arrhythmias and heart
failure{[}\textsuperscript{30}{]}\textsuperscript{31}.

\textbf{Myocardial infarction}

{[}Try to briefly mention the main advances that have powered this
marked reduction in CVD events: much lower smoking prevalence, better
management of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, but also thrombolysis,
stents and CABGs becoming standard practice.{]}

Myocardial infarction (MI) occurs due to the rupture of an
atherosclerotic plaque in the coronary arteries, triggering thrombus
formation that blocks blood flow. This leads to oxygen deprivation
(ischemia) and subsequent myocardial injury or necrosis. If untreated,
this process can cause extensive cardiac damage and fatal arrhythmias.
Over the past decades, the incidence of myocardial infarction (MI) has
declined in high-income countries(ref.) with a marked reduction in
MI-related mortality(ref.). These improvements are largely attributed to
a combination of public health initiatives and medical advances. On the
public health front, a substantial decrease in smoking prevalence has
been the most important lifestyle-related factor contributing to the
reduction in CVD {[}\textsuperscript{32}{]}\textsuperscript{33}.
Medically, the improved preventive management of hypertension and
hyperlipidemia has reduced the burden of atherosclerotic disease. In
acute care, the widespread adoption of evidence-based interventions such
as thrombolytic therapy, percutaneous coronary interventions (including
stenting), and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) has improved
survival and outcomes following MI. In T2D, the risk of MI is elevated
by 72\%, with an approximately threefold risk among patients under 60
years compared to age under 60 without T2D\textsuperscript{34}. Similar
to the general population, its incidence and fatality have declined in
diabetes.

\textbf{Stroke}

The majority of strokes are ischemic, caused by an obstruction in a
cerebral artery, often due to an atherosclerotic plaque or embolism. The
second main cause is hemorrhagic stroke, which is characterized as a
hypertensive small-vessel disease, leading to small lipohyalinotic
aneurysms that subsequently rupture, causing intracerebral
bleeding\textsuperscript{35}. Ischemic stroke remains one of the global
leading contributor to mortality and disability\textsuperscript{36}. The
incidence, prevalence, and cause-specific mortality of stroke remain
high but have stagnated, although some declines have been observed in
high-income countries\textsuperscript{37}. Stroke risk is already
elevated at high levels of glucose (fasting plasma, OGTT, and HbA1c)
among people in a pre-diabetic range where the the risk exceed of 26\%
higher risk compared to population without diabetes
{[}\textsuperscript{38}{]}\textsuperscript{39}. In T2D, the ischemic
stroke risk is elevated almost two-fold compared with individuals
without diabetes\textsuperscript{34}.

\hypertarget{heart-failure}{%
\subsection{Heart failure}\label{heart-failure}}

Heart failure develops gradually with age and often accelerates with the
progression of T2D. As prevention and treatment of CVD have improved
survival in recent years, the prevalence of heart failure has increased,
while the incidence remains stable, but may rise with aging
populations\textsuperscript{40}.

Heart failure is commonly classified as either ischemic or non-ischemic
in origin. It may arise as a consequence of atherosclerosis,
arteriosclerosis, or both, contributing to myocardial ischemia, pressure
overload, and structural cardiac changes. Heart failure is a clinical
condition characterized by symptoms of breathlessness, fatigue, and
fluid retention, often accompanied by clinical signs such as pulmonary
crepitations, jugular venous elevation, and peripheral edema. Heart
failure can be defined hemodynamically as the inability to maintain
adequate cardiac output at rest or during exertion, or the ability to do
so only with elevated cardiac filling pressures. It is a complex
cardiovascular disease caused by structural and functional changes in
the heart musculature, affecting systolic and/or diastolic pumping
function. Heart failure is generally classified into two subtypes: heart
failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and heart failure with
preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Both subtypes involve cardiac
remodeling but are defined by left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF).
HFrEF is defined by an LVEF \textless{} 40\%, while HFpEF is
characterized by an LVEF ≥ 50\% along with structural or functional
cardiac abnormalities, as assessed by echocardiography. HFrEF is often a
consequence of repeated, non-fatal myocardial infarctions. These events
can leave behind scar tissue in the myocardium, impairing the heart's
ability to contract effectively and leading to progressive systolic
dysfunction.

The most common feature of HFpEF is left ventricular diastolic
dysfunction, caused by impaired relaxation and increased stiffness,
leading to elevated left atrial pressure and reduced diastolic
reserve\textsuperscript{41}. Over the past decades, the prevalence of
HFpEF has increased with an aging population and more people living with
conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. It is diagnosed
based on structural or functional abnormalities identified through
echocardiographic measures, such as left ventricular hypertrophy, left
atrial enlargement, or elevated filling pressures\textsuperscript{42}.
The diagnosis may seem straightforward, but it is often challenging in
community settings, as patients frequently present without typical heart
failure symptoms (e.g., shortness of breath) and are not routinely
assessed with biomarkers like N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide
(NT-proBNP) or brain-neuretic-peptide (BNP). As a result, HFpEF is
commonly underdiagnosed and consequently detected at more severe stages,
leading to hospitalization\textsuperscript{42}.

\hypertarget{cardiovascular-autonomic-dysfunction}{%
\section{Cardiovascular autonomic
dysfunction}\label{cardiovascular-autonomic-dysfunction}}

The cardiovascular system is regulated by autonomic nervous system which
influences heart rate and vasoconstrictuion through neurotransmitter
release by the sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves. The primary
neurotransmitter of the sympathetic nervous system is noradrenaline,
while the parasympathetic nervous system primarily releases
acetylcholine by stimulation through the Vagus nerve. Sympathetic
activation increases heart rate and myocardial contractility by
stimulating the sinoatrial (SA) node, atrioventricular (AV) node, and
ventricular myocardium. In contrast, parasympathetic activation
primarily reduces heart rate by directly modulating SA node activity
through vagal stimulation. It also slows AV nodal conduction,
predominantly via the left vagus nerve, thereby prolonging
atrioventricular conduction time. Afferently nerves mainly carry sensory
information (e.g., baroreceptor input from the carotid sinus and aortic
arch) to the brain, which then adjusts efferent autonomic output to
regulate arterial tone. Hence, the autonomic nervous system dynamically
regulates heart rate and blood pressure to maintain homoeostasis in
response to physiological demands, such as rest and physical activity.

{[}insert figure of brain heart and symphathtic nerves{]}

In youth, the autonomic nervous system is highly adaptive and responsive
to living conditions, maintaining autonomic balance. However, with
aging, there is a gradual decline in parasympathetic function and an
increase in sympathetic activity. Additionally, metabolic-related
conditions such as obesity and diabetes have been shown to further
contribute to autonomic dysfunction. Autonomic dysfunction reflects a
stressed cardiometabolic environment, as both dysfunction in lipid and
glucose metabolism are associated with increased sympathetic
activity\textsuperscript{43}. This dysfunction may result from
cumulative neural damage mediated by mechanisms such as
hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, and elevated levels of adipokines.
At the same time, autonomic dysfunction is known to disrupt lipid and
glucose metabolism\textsuperscript{43}. Therefore, the relationship
between autonomic dysfunction and cardiometabolic factors is likely a
vicious cycle\textsuperscript{44}. The consequences can lead to
cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction/neuropathy (CAN), resulting
dysregulation in heart rate and vascular dynamics. In this dissertation,
we will use `cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction' as the broader term,
while `CAN' will refer specifically to autonomic dysfunction resulting
from neuropathy in T2D.

Cardiovascular autonomic function can be assessed using heart rate
variability (HRV) indices, which measure the variation in successive
normal RR intervals in milliseconds. HRV provides time- and
frequency-domain estimates of the balance between sympathetic and
parasympathetic activity. High HRV reflects an autonomic nervous system
with strong adaptability to the body's demands, whereas low variation
indicates poor adaptation to changing conditions. HRV changes in
response to different physiological or environmental conditions (e.g.,
sleep, stress, posture, physical activity), and these changes can be
observed in its natural 24-hour (diurnal) pattern\textsuperscript{13}.
Most studies have examined cardiovascular autonomic function using
short-term ECG recordings at rest. However, extended HRV recordings
across the circadian cycle may offer deeper insights into the influence
of lower-frequency variability sources, such as very-low frequency
(0.003--0.04 Hz) and ultra-low frequency (≤0.003 Hz){[}reflecting
what{]}. HRV has been applied across several research domains. For
example, in psychology as a marker of mental stress, in exercise
physiology as an indicator of recovery, in cardiovascular research as a
marker of autonomic dysfunction due to cardiac complications, and in
diabetes research as a marker of autonomic
neuropathy(ref.,ref.ref.,ref.). T2D alters the expression of sympathetic
bursts, as measured by resting muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA).
MSNA is elevated in individuals with both T2D and hypertension, compared
to those who are normotensive, regardless of whether they have diabetes
or not\textsuperscript{45}. Parasympathetic activity is also impaired in
individuals with high cardiometabolic risk and T2D, as reflected by
reduced baroreflex sensitivity\textsuperscript{46} and lower HF and
RMSSD short-term HRV. Before onset of diabetes and during progression of
diabetes long-term (24-hour) HRV has shown to be lower compare to those
with normal glucose metabolism
{[}\textsuperscript{44}{]}\textsuperscript{8}. Cardiovascular autonomic
reflex tests (CARTs) and orthostatic hypotension are considered the gold
standard for assessing CAN\textsuperscript{47}. The diagnosis includes
assessing pulse rate ratio under test conditions, such as the deep
breathing test, the lying-to-standing test, and the Valsalva
maneuver\textsuperscript{47}. Both HRV and CARTs have shown to be
associated with cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and all-cause
mortality, primarily in populations with T2D or established
cardiovascular disease. However, it remains unclear at which stage in
the progression of diabetes risk to pre-diabetes to diabetes these
measures begin to influence the risk of cardiovascular complications.

\hypertarget{risk-stratification}{%
\section{Risk-stratification}\label{risk-stratification}}

Current cardiopreventive guidelines place strong emphasis on prevent and
treat T2D. The 2022 ADA/EASD guidelines for the management of
hyperglycemia in T2D recommend, cardioprotective medication (GLP-1
receptor analogues and SGLT2-inhibitors) as first-line options for
individuals at high cardiovascular risk. Due to their benefits in heart
failure, SGLT2 inhibitors are specifically recommended for patients with
documented HFrEF or HFpEF. High cardiovascular risk is defined as the
presence of at least two risk factors at age \textgreater55 years, such
as obesity, hypertension, smoking, dyslipidemia, or albuminuria.
However, no additional preclinical markers are recommended to identify
individuals at higher CVD or HF risk. Despite their increased risk of
cardiovascular complications, individuals at high risk of developing
diabetes remain outside structured treatment options, even though
diabetes risk and cardiometabolic markers can be successfully modified
through lifestyle interventions and medication such as GLP-1 analogoues
{[}\textsuperscript{48}{]}\textsuperscript{49}. During the progression
and following the onset of T2D, preclinical stages may be characterized
by markers of elevated cardiovascular risk, highlighting the potential
for early risk stratification. Risk stratification is the process of
classifying or ranking individuals in increasing order of estimated
risk, based on risk scores, biomarker levels, omic data (metabolomic,
proteomics, and genomic) or preclinical conditions. This approach aids
in identifying patients for prognostic or diagnostic purposes,
identifying subgroups that require further evaluation, intensified
treatment, or lifestyle modifications.

Cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction despite it's relationship with
cardiovascular complication has not been used in clinical practice.
Larger epidemiological cohort studies encompassing various stages of
diabetes risk, from normal glucose metabolism to prediabetes, onset of
T2D, and longer term progression of T2D, serve as valuable resources for
identifying risk-stratification opportunities. Epidemiological studies
provide a broad representation of the target population, allowing
understand the relationship between cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction
and cardiovascular complications. They also have potential to determine
when, along the trajectory of diabetes progression and duration,
autonomic function are meaningful for cardiovascular
risk-stratification.

\hypertarget{aim-and-hypothesis}{%
\chapter{Aim and hypothesis}\label{aim-and-hypothesis}}

The hypotheses of this dissertation are:

CAN and autonomic dysfunction is associated with CVD and acts as an
early risk factor for heart failure and other cardiovascular
complications, including stroke, and myocardial infarction in patients
with prediabetes and/or T2D. In addition autonomic dysfunction is
associated with higher levels of sub-clinical meassures such as
carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity and carotid artery distensibility.

This dissertation investigates the hypothesis by addressing the
following three aims:

Study I: Quantify the cross-sectional association between 24-hour HRV
and subclinical markers of cardiovascular complications: carotid-femoral
pulse wave velocity and carotid artery distensibility, in a participants
with normal glucose metabolism, prediabetes or T2D.

Study II: Quantify the longitudinal association of week-long and hourly
HRV with incidence ischemic-CVD, heart failure, and all-cause mortality
in a population with high-risk of diabetes.

Study III: Quantify the cross-sectional association between CAN and
heart failure. Heart failure will be defined by clinical measures
i.e.~N-terminal-pro-BNP (Pro-BNP), WATCH-DM risk, and New York Heart
Association (NYHA) scores among individuals with T2D.

\subsubsection{Study I - The Maastricht
Study}\label{study-i---the-maastricht-study}}

The Maastricht Study is a prospective observational population-based
study of the general population of the province of Limburg, in the
southern part of the Netherlands. The study emphasized the recruitment
of people with T2D, through the regional Diabetes Patient Registry, to
extensively phenotype individuals with T2D and those in intermediate
stages of the disease. The eligibility criteria included an age range of
40--70 years. Participants were recruited through mass media campaigns
and mailings from municipal registries (Gemeentelijke Basis
Administratie; GBA). In the analysis of Study I, the study among 7449
people included participants with measurements of 24-hour HRV and at
least one measure of arterial stiffness (carotid-femoral pulse wave
velocity or carotid artery distensibility), both of which were completed
within a three-month period between November 2010 and December 2020. The
study has been approved by the institutional medical ethics committee
(NL31329.068.10) and the Minister of Health, Welfare and Sports of the
Netherlands (Permit 131088-105234-PG). All participants gave written i

\hypertarget{study-ii---addition-pro}{%
\subsubsection{Study II - ADDITION-PRO}\label{study-ii---addition-pro}}

The ADDITION-PRO study is a prospective, population-based cohort nested
within the Danish arm of the ADDITION-Europe study. ADDITION was
originally designed as a stepwise screening program for T2D in general
practice, aiming to identify individuals with screen-detected T2D for
recruitment into the ADDITION trial. ADDITION-PRO aims to investigate
early markers of CVD and metabolic dysfunction in individuals in
different tiers of diabetes risk.

The ADDITION-Europe screening program identified a large number of
individuals with impaired fasting glucose (IFG), impaired glucose
tolerance (IGT), and normoglycemia despite having risk factors for
diabetes and CVD. Participants for ADDITION-PRO were recruited from the
original ADDITION-DK screening cohort, which included individuals from
190 general practices across Denmark. The recruitment strategy focused
on individuals at high risk of diabetes without T2D, identified through
a stepwise screening program that incorporated the Danish diabetes risk
score from the Inter99. This assessment, conducted between 2001 and
2006, considered factors such as age, sex, history of gestational
diabetes, family history of diabetes, known hypertension, BMI, and
physical activity. High-risk individuals were further screened for T2D
using blood measurements, including HbA1c, random blood glucose, FPG,
and OGTT. Those with screen-detected diabetes, confirmed by a second
OGTT, were invited to participate in the ADDITION trial. High risk
individuals without T2D were further considered in as the sampling frame
for ADDITION-PRO.

Between 2009 and 2011, a follow-up health examination was conducted at
four ADDITION-DK study centers to establish a cohort baseline. Eligible
participants were those still alive, residing near the research centers
(Steno Diabetes Center Copenhagen, Aarhus University Hospital, Holstebro
Hospital, and the Hospital of South West Jutland, Esbjerg), and who had
not withdrawn consent. Eligibility criteria included individuals aged
40--70 years who had previously undergone diabetes screening in
ADDITION-DK. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy, psychological or
psychiatric disorder preventing informed consent, and life-limiting
conditions. One key feature of the data collection was the precise
measurement of physical activity and energy expenditure using a combined
chest worn accelerometer/heart rate monitor (ActiHeart), which recorded
acceleration and heart rate over a week. In study II, we included
participants with a least 48-hour recording for our first analysis, and
then include those participants with hourly measures of physical
acceleration during the hourly HRV recording for th second analysis. We
also excluded participant with prior CVD ten years before inclusion.

Disease history and follow-up data for the population were obtained from
Denmark's unique national registry system, which allows linkage of
health records using the personal Civil Registration Number assigned to
all citizens. The following national registries were accessed to collect
information on incident CVD and mortality, medication use, and
healthcare utilization: the National Patient Registry (hospital
admissions and outpatient contacts), the National Health Service
Registry (general practice visits), the Medical Prescription Registry,
the Diabetes Registry, and the Cause of Death Registry.

\hypertarget{study-iii---cancan}{%
\subsubsection{Study III - CANCAN}\label{study-iii---cancan}}

The CANCAN Study is an observational study conducted at two hospital
outpatient clinics in Viborg Regional Hospital and Regional Hospital
Gødstrup. It aims to implement a screening protocol for identifying
high-risk individuals using CAN assessments, continuous glucose
monitoring, and heart failure indicators. All measures were part of
routine clinical care for T2D in Central Denmark. We included 200 adults
(\textgreater18 years) with T2D with duration of over one year.
Exclusion criteria were recent laser-treated eye disease (≤3 months),
pregnancy, lactation, life-threatening illness, or cognitive impairment
preventing consent. Participants were identified via electronic records
and informed about the study by their doctor during a telephone call.
Those interested attended a dedicated meeting before their annual
diabetes exam, where study details were discussed. Recruitment took
place from 2021 to 2024. In study III, participants without a valid
NT-proBNP measurement were excluded.

In study I-III a device was used to capture the distance between each
heartbeat defined as RR intervals from electrocardiogram traces either
directly from heart-beat traces or indirectly from pulse traces. From
this a sequence of successive heart beat intervals is extracted to
calculate HRV. The pool of hearbeat data, we extrapolated time-domain
and frequency-domain HRV indices.

\emph{Time-domain indices}

Time-domain measures of HRV are based on the statistical distribution of
normal-to-normal (NN) heartbeat intervals. Description of time-domain
indices are summarized in \textbf{?@tbl-td}.

\emph{Frequency-domain indices}

Frequency-domain HRV indices are derived from sequences of NN intervals
transformed into the spectral domain using Fourier transformation. These
indices quantify heart rate oscillations over different timescales.
Short-term variations, such as respiratory sinus arrhythmia, reflect
rapid autonomic changes, while longer oscillations capture autonomic
responses to posture changes, circadian rhythms, or other physiological
processes. Description of frequency-domain indices are summarized in

\textbf{Holter recordings in study I}

All ECG recordings were obtained using a 12-lead Holter system
(Fysiologic ECG Services, Amsterdam, the Netherlands) over 24 hours, as
previously described. Participants were instructed to follow their
regular daily activities but avoid showering during the recording. The
ECG data were processed using proprietary Holter Analysis Software
(Fysiologic ECG Services), where artefacts and ectopic beats were
excluded through automated processing and manual validation. A minimum
recording duration of 18 hours was required for further analysis.
Inter-beat intervals between consecutive sinus beats were provided in
milliseconds (ms). Time-domain HRV indices were calculated, including
SDNN, SDANN, RMSSD, SDNN index, and pNN50. Frequency-domain measures
were derived using Fast Fourier Transform, including TP, ULF, VLF, LF,
and HF. Outliers were removed. HRV indices were standardised by their
mean and SD, and composite Z-scores were computed for time and
frequency-domain measures, respectively. This selection of indices
covers the main sources of HRV variance.

\textbf{ActiHeart heart rate and physical activity in study II}

Heart rate was measured using a combined accelerometer and heart rate
monitor (ActiHeart, CamNTech, Cambridge, UK), recording uniaxial
acceleration and heart rate. The data collection and processing methods
have been described previously. Mean heart rates were recorded in
30-second epochs, and HRV was derived as the variation between
consecutive normal heartbeats on the ECG. HRV calculations were
performed using the RHRV package (version 4.2.7) in R, including SDNN,
SDANN, SDNN index, TINN, and mean HR (mHR). We tested our approach on a
dataset with full access to all interbeat intervals to validate our
algorithm\textsuperscript{57}. These indices have shown high validity
for HRV indices based on global distribution (e.g.~SDNN, SDANN, SDNNi)
in 24-hour recordings. HRV indices were calculated by week, 24-hour
cycle, and hour of the day, with hourly values averaged across recording
days.

\textbf{Vagus device for cardiovascular autonomic reflex test in study
III}

CAN was diagnosed using cardiovascular autonomic reflex tests (CARTs),
the gold standard for CAN assessment. R-R intervals were derived from an
ECG signal using the Vagus™ device (Medicus Engineering, Aarhus,
Denmark). We used pulse rate ratios measured under different conditions.
Three standardized cardiovascular autonomic reflex tests (CARTs) were
performed---lying-to-standing, deep breathing, and the Valsalva
manoeuvre, following a standardized protocol conducted between 8:00 a.m.
and 2:00 p.m., after 10 minutes of supine rest. Smoking and caffeine
intake were prohibited two hours before testing. Each test was conducted
once by trained examiners.

Manifest CAN was defined as two or more abnormal CARTs using
age-specific cut-off values (ref.). The Vagus™ device's accuracy has
been validated against FDA standards and stationary devices, showing
moderate to high reproducibility (ref.).

HRV was derived from all CARTs using autoregressive spectral analysis.
Time domain measures included SDNN and RMSSD, while frequency domain
measures included LF, HF, and total power. Orthostatic hypertension was
defined as a sustained drop in systolic blood pressure of ≥20 mmHg or
diastolic blood pressure of ≥10 mmHg within three minutes of standing
(ref.).

\hypertarget{confounders-and-variables-for-instrumental-bias}{%
\subsection{Confounders and variables for instrumental
bias}\label{confounders-and-variables-for-instrumental-bias}}

Across Studies I, II, and III, a comprehensive set of covariates and
potential confounders were assessed, including lifestyle factors,
clinical measurements, biochemical markers, and socioeconomic
indicators.

Smoking status was self-reported in all studies, categorized as never,
former, or current (Study I), current/ex/never (Study II), and
smoker/non-smoker (Study III). Alcohol consumption was recorded as
average weekly units in all three studies. Physical activity was
assessed via self-report in Studies I, II, III, with Study I capturing
total and moderate-to-vigorous activity (hours/week), Study II used the
Recent Physical Activity Questionnaire (RPAQ) to calculate physical
activity energy expenditure (PAEE), and Study III classifying activity
as sedentary or non-sedentary. In Study II also used combined
accelerometry and heart rate monitoring (ActiHeart) to estimate PAEE.
Study II included register-based data on socioeconomic status at
baseline, including education length, income, and employment status. All
studies included measurements of body mass index (BMI), waist
circumference, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure, obtained
during clinical examinations.

Blood samples were analyzed in all studies for HbA1c, fasting plasma
glucose (FPG), triglycerides, total cholesterol, high-density
lipoprotein (HDL), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Study
I also included a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) to classify
glucose metabolism status based on FPG and OGTT (normal, prediabetes,
T2D) using WHO 2006 criteria, excluding HbA1c as a diagnostic criterion.
Study III additionally measured creatinine, estimated glomerular
filtration rate (eGFR), and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio.

Self-reported history of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and use of
anti-hypertensive, glucose-lowering, and lipid-lowering medications were
collected in all studies. In Study II, history of CVD events in the 10
years prior to baseline were retrieved from national registers. In Study
III, history of CVD was collected electronic patient records.

\hypertarget{arterial-stiffness}{%
\subsection{Arterial stiffness}\label{arterial-stiffness}}

Arterial stiffness characterized arteriosclerosis and atherosclerosis
properties of the arteries. The stiffness of different trees of the
vascular musculature can assessed both locally and dynamically. Aortic
and carotid stiffness were assessed as markers of arterial stiffness,
following previously described procedures\textsuperscript{58}.

\textbf{Pulse wave velocity}

Aortic stiffness was measured by carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity
(cf-PWV) using applanation tonometry (SphygmoCor, Atcor Medical, Sydney,
Australia), with the median of at least three consecutive recordings
included in the analysis. cf-PWV is calculated from the time between the
ECG systole and the arrival of the pressure wave at the femoral and
carotid measurement sites and the distance between these two measurement
sites. It is measured with participants in a supine position following a
10-minute rest period. The aortic path length was determined using a
tape measure by subtracting the carotid-to-sternal notch distance from
the femoral-to-sternal notch distance\textsuperscript{58}.

\textbf{Carotid artery distensibility}

Carotid stiffness was assessed by the carotid artery distensibility
coefficient (CD), based on ultrasound imaging of the left common carotid
artery using a 7.5 MHz linear probe (MyLab 70, Esaote Europe,
Maastricht, the Netherlands). CD was calculated as ΔD/braPP, where ΔD
represents carotid distension and braPP is brachial pulse pressure. Mean
heart rate and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were recorded every five
minutes using an oscillometer device (Accutorr Plus, Datascope,
Montvale, NJ, USA)\textsuperscript{58}..

\hypertarget{indicators-of-heart-failure}{%
\subsection{Indicators of heart
failure}\label{indicators-of-heart-failure}}

N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) is a
neuretic peptide that can be used to detect patients with heart failure
and the progression. It derives from B-type natriuretic peptid (BNP)
which is a cardial neurohormon, that is syntezied and secreted as
response to streched cariomycytes and cardiac volume overload. After
secretion, proBNP is cleaved, releasing the active hormone BNP along
with the remaining N-terminal fragment, known as NT-proBNP. In Study
III, blood sample were taken at Study cite. Description of the NT-proBNP
analysis of plasma samples is described in supplementary material
{[}ref.{]}.

We used a modified version validated The WATCH-DM heart failure risk
score. The risk score is based on 9 variables: two binary (history of
myocardial infarction and coronary artery bypass grafting) and seven
continuous (age, BMI, systolic/diastolic BP, serum creatinine, HDL
cholesterol, and HbA1c). Scores range from 0--39, categorized as very
low (≤11), low (12--13), moderate (14--15), high (16--18), and very high
(≥19) risk.

NYHA class stage I-IV was included. Heart failure symptoms were defined
as NYHA class II--IV, assessed by a physician.

\hypertarget{cross-sectional-analysis}{%
\subsection{Cross-sectional analysis}\label{cross-sectional-analysis}}

In Study I, we used multiple linear regression to investigate
associations between multiday HRV and arterial stiffness. Model 1
adjusted for age, sex, education, glucose metabolism status, and mean
arterial pressure (MAP) to account for the oversampling of individuals
with T2D and potential instrumental bias of arterial pressure flow.
Model 2 included additional adjustments for smoking behavior, alcohol
consumption, physical activity, body mass index, HbA1c, triglycerides,
total-to-HDL cholesterol ratio, and medication use. Arterial stiffness
measures were log-transformed to ensure normally distributed residuals
and back-transformed into percentage change estimates. We add
interaction sex to oberve if the association differed between sex. We
performed sensitivity analyses excluding individuals on antihypertensive
treatment or glucose-lowering medication. In Study III, we applied
logistic regression models to investigate the association between CAN
and heart failure, using NT-proBNP as the primary outcome. We adjusted
for age, sex, and diabetes duration, smoking behavior, alcohol
consumption, body mass index, HbA1c, triglycerides, total cholesterol,
and antihypertensive medication, eGFR and prior CVD. We performed
sensitivity analyses excluded participants with beta-blocker treatment
or prior CVD.

\hypertarget{time-to-event-analysis}{%
\subsection{Time-to-event analysis}\label{time-to-event-analysis}}

In Study II, we used Poisson regression models to quantify the
associations between HRV and cardiovascular events, as follow-up data
were undisturbed over time and to avoid assumptions of proportional
hazards\textsuperscript{59}. Multiday HRV was modelled using splines
with knots at predefined percentiles to assess non-linear associations.
Hourly HRV was analysed separately for each hour to observe if the
association of HRV had diurnal variation. Both HRV and mHR were
standardized by their mean and standard deviation to ensure
comparability. Based on assumptions about potential confounding pathways
summarized in directed acyclic graphs (DAG), we fitted two models: Model
1 adjusted for age and sex, while Model 2 further adjusted for
education, smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity (physical
activity energy expenditure (PAEE) calculated from Recent Physical
Activity Questionnaire RPAQ), body mass index, total cholesterol, and
HbA1c. Additional analyses were performed with HRV pre-adjusted for
concurrent heart rate and physical acceleration to account the influence
of these factors. Missing covariates were handled using multiple
imputation. {[}Add age specific incidence rates{]}

\hypertarget{effect-modification-det-kan-evt.-kortes-ned}{%
\subsection{Effect modification {[}det kan evt. kortes
ned{]}}\label{effect-modification-det-kan-evt.-kortes-ned}}

Effect modification is used to assess whether the association between an
exposure and an outcome varies depending on the level of a third
variable, known as the effect modifier. This means that the observed
relationship between the exposure and the outcome is not uniform across
all subgroups. Instead, it differs across strata defined by the effect
modifier\textsuperscript{60}.

In Study I, we hypothesize that the association between 24-hour and
arterial stiffness was stronger in strata of progression of diabetes
(normal glucose metabolism, prediabetes, T2D). We therefore first
stratified by diabetes status to observe the size of the association
across strata. We then combine all groups and include an interaction
term between HRV and diabetes status. We did subsidiary analysis to
check if the effect was modified by dysglycemia by stratifying HbA1c and
fasting plasma glucose into deciles. In Study II, we quatified whether
the association between multiday HRV and CVD endpoints varied by sex to
explore potential biological dimorphism.

In Study III, we aimed to determine whether the association between CAN
and elevated NT-proBNP is present in the subgroup without symptoms,
defined as NYHA class \textless{} II. Hence, we hypothesized no
significant effect modification between groups with and without
symptoms. Similarly, we explored whether the association remains present
in the group classified as low to moderate risk of heart failure, based
on the WATCH-DM risk score.

A significant effect modification between the exposure and the effect
modifier in all analyses was defined as an interaction term with a
p-value \textless{} 0.05.

\hypertarget{multiple-imputed-by-chained-equations}{%
\subsection{Multiple imputed by chained
equations}\label{multiple-imputed-by-chained-equations}}

Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE) is a method for handling
missing data in datasets. This procedure imputes missing values through
an iterative series of predictive models, generating plausible estimates
while preserving the relationships within the data. To avoid one
imputation for missing value could give the value the same confidence as
the a non-missing value, we followed Rubins Rule. Rubin's rules in MICE
combine results from multiple imputed datasets by pooling estimates of
interest (e.g., means or regression coefficients) using their within-
and between-imputation variances. Thus, we ensure valid statistical
inferences by accounting for the uncertainty introduced by missing data.

In Study II, we imputed confounders to include as many participants and
avoid excluding population with our without cardiovascular or mortality
events. We imputed dataset 10 times. In Study III, we imputed missing
CART, as a proportion of participants had non-valid test due to
insufficient air in the valsalva manuevre, unstable heart beats or data
error. These variables was used as auxiliary variables in imputation to
reduce bias\textsuperscript{61}. All available variables of biochemical
measures, diagnosis, medication and cause of non-valid CART was used to
impute each missing CART using predictive mean matching.

\hypertarget{instrumental-bias}{%
\subsection{Instrumental bias}\label{instrumental-bias}}

In Study I-III we are investigating the body properties by dynamic
measures and biomarkers to quantify autonomic function, arterial
stiffness, and cardiac function. Other conditions may affect the
properties we are attempting to measure, and thus are causing
instrumental bias.

\emph{Vascular Stiffness}

In Study I, we used measurements of arterial stiffness using cf-PWV and
carotid distensibilty. Both measures are influenced by arterial pressure
at the time of examination. Arterial pressure affects the propagation of
the pressure wave through the aorta (cf-PWV) and the expansion and
contraction of the carotid artery (carotid distensibilty) {[}ref.{]}. To
account for this, we adjusted for mean arterial pressure in our models.

\emph{Cardiovascular autonomic function}

In Study II, we assessed cardiovascular autonomic function using
multiday HRV recordings and hourly HRV measurements. Studies have
highlighted that HRV is dependent on heart rate, and low HRV may simply
reflect a higher resting heart rate (rHR). To adjust for this without
overcorrecting for a collinear variable, we pre-adjusted HRV by
regressing rHR on HRV, extracting the residuals, and using these as the
pre-adjusted determinant. For hourly HRV, variability in heart rate may
be influenced by changes in physical activity, creating a risk that HRV
serves as a proxy for movement rather than autonomic function. To
address this, we applied a similar pre-adjustment approach by regressing
concurrent heart rate and physical acceleration to account for physical
activity.

\emph{Biomarker of Heart Failure}

In Study III, kidney function and overweight are know to influence
NT-proBNP levels independently of heart failure. We adjusted the model
to account for the blurred effect of eGFR on NT-proBNP levels in the
analysis.

cf-PWV (aortic stiffness) became higher with diabetes status: NGM: 8.08

prediabetes: 13.5 (10.4, 16.9), and T2D: 12.5 (9.9, 16.0) × 10⁻³/kPa.
SDNN (ms) was highest in NGM and decreased with worsening glucose

The association between HRV time-domain Z-scores and cf-PWV and CD was

modified by prediabetes (8.3 \%{[}CI:3.6;
13.2{]}\(^{*^{p-value< 0.01}}\)) but not by T2D (5.3 \%{[}CI:1.4;
9.4{]}\(^{*^{p-value< 0.1}}\)). For the indices total power and ULF, the
association with both cf-PWV and CD was significantly modified by both
prediabetes and T2D. Mean inter beat interval association with cf-PWV or
CD was not significantly modified by diabetes status.

As I did not observe a stepwise increase in the modification of glucose
metabolism status from prediabetes to T2D, I excluded the subgroup with
T2D to test whether the association was gradually modified by
dysglycemia. In this subgroup, the association between HRV time and
frequency domain Z-scores and measures of arterial stiffness was
modified by HbA1c (range of interaction p-values: 0.1 to 0.005) (see
Figure Figure~\ref{fig-MS-HRV}). For example, per SD lower HRV frequency
domain Z-score at HbA1c 6.4\% was associated with a 5.4\% higher (CI:
3.5; 7.2) cf-PWV, which was 2.0\% to 4.0\% higher compared to the
magnitude of association at HbA1c levels of 5.6\% and 4.8\% (see see
Figure~\ref{fig-MS-HRV} B). In CD, per SD lower HRV frequency domain
Z-score at HbA1c 6.4\% was associated with an 8.1\% lower (CI: -13.5;
-2.9) CD, which was 4.8\% to 9.5\% lower compared to the magnitude of
association at HbA1c levels of 5.6\% and 4.8\% (see
Figure~\ref{fig-MS-HRV} D). No association between HRV frequency domain
Z-score and CD was observed at HbA1c levels between 4.8\% and 5.2\%.

The ADDITION-PRO population consisted of 1,627 participant with a least
48-hour HRV measures, while 1,432 had all hour represented with hourly
HRV and physical acceleration. The study population included different
tiers of diabetes risk: 154 individuals at low risk (9\%), 889 at high
risk (51\%), 314 with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) (18\%), 226 with
impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) (13\%), and 161 with both IFG and IGT
(9\%). I splitted SDNN into categories by very-low (SDNN\textless{} 100
ms), low (SDNN 100-120 ms), middle (SDNN 121-140 ms), high (SDNN 141-160
ms) and very-high (SDNN \textgreater160 ms).

Charteristics are desribed in Table~\ref{tbl-add}. Participants in the
lowest SDNN group (\textless100 ms) were older (67.4 ± 6.9 years), had
higher BMI (28.1 ± 5.4), HbA1c (5.9 ± 0.9), triglycerides (1.5 ± 0.9
mmol/L), and resting heart rate (67.8 ± 5.7 bpm), were more likely to
use anti-hypertensive medication (61\%), and had lower physical activity
energy expenditure (46.8 ± 24.0 kJ/day) compared to those with higher
SDNN levels.

\subsection{Multiday HRV and MACE, heart failure, and all-cause
mortality.}\label{multiday-hrv-and-mace-heart-failure-and-all-cause-mortality.}}

The mean multiday SDNN was 139.0 (32.3) ms, and the mean heart rate was
73.5 (9.1) bpm. In the fully adjusted model, SDNN per SD was associated
with a lower incidence rate ratio (IRR) for MACE 0.82 (CI: 0.69; 0.97),
heart failure 0.76 (CI: 0.58; 0.99), and mortality rate ratio of 0.79
(CI: 0.66; 0.94). When I pre-adjusted for resting heart rate, the
proportion of the association explained between HRV and MACE, HF, and
all-cause mortality was 14\%, 25\%, and 19\%, respectively. I included
knots in the model, which showed that the risk became higher when SDNN
fell below 120 to 110 ms (approximately below the 20th percentile),
suggesting a potential cut-off point for higher risk. I therefore
calculated the incidence rate (IR) at SDNN levels of 100 ms, 120 ms, and
160 ms, respectively, and plotted these as a function of age.

\end{figure}

At age 65, the IR per 1000 person-years for MACE was 44.2 (CI: 33.5;
58.3) at SDNN = 100 ms, which was higher than the rates observed at SDNN
= 120 ms (IR: 37.6 {[}CI: 29.2; 48.3{]}) and SDNN = 160 ms (IR: 34.7
{[}CI: 27.0; 44.5{]}) (Figure~\ref{fig-addprohrv} A). The IR became
higher with age, reaching its peak at age 72. For heart failure at age
65, the IR was 20.5 (CI: 15.3; 27.5) at SDNN = 100 ms, slightly higher
than at SDNN = 120 ms (IR: 19.6 {[}CI: 14.8; 25.9{]}) and SDNN = 160 ms
(IR: 19.8 {[}CI: 15.0; 26.2{]}) (Figure~\ref{fig-addprohrv} B). The IR
remained stable until age 70, after which it became higher. For
all-cause mortality at age 65, the IR was 11.6 (CI: 6.3; 21.4) at SDNN =
100 ms, higher than at SDNN = 120 ms (IR: 7.6 {[}CI: 4.3; 13.3{]}) and
SDNN = 160 ms (IR: 6.0 {[}CI: 3.4; 10.4{]}) (Figure~\ref{fig-addprohrv}

\subsection{Hourly HRV and MACE, heart failure, and all-cause
mortality.}\label{hourly-hrv-and-mace-heart-failure-and-all-cause-mortality.}}

From the hourly recordings, I observed a clear periodicity in SDNN,
heart rate, sleep patterns, and physical acceleration. Mean (SD) SDNN
increased from 5--6 AM (70.2 {[}28.8{]} ms), peaking at 8--9 AM (92.1
{[}29.0{]} ms), followed by a gradual decline, reaching its lowest point
around 2 AM the next day (64.1 {[}28.1{]} ms). A similar circadian
pattern was observed in heart rate, although its peak occurred two hours
later, starting at 9 AM (76.7 {[}10.9{]} bpm). After peaking, heart rate
remained stable throughout the afternoon before gradually decreasing.

In Figure~\ref{fig-ADD_PRO_risk_by_hour}, I observe hourly SDNN
(preadjusted for heart rate and physical acceleration), heart rate, and
physical acceleration association. Models was adjusted for age, sex,
education, alcohol consumption, smoking behavior, BMI, total
cholesterol, and Hba1c. The morning response of SDNN was most indicative
of MACE, with the strongest association observed from 6--7 AM (IRR:
0.84; 95\% CI: 0.71 to 1.00 per SD higher SDNN) (see
Figure~\ref{fig-ADD_PRO_risk_by_hour} A).Heart rate between 12 AM and 6
AM showed a small trend toward higher risk of MACE (IRR range: 1.11 to
1.15 per SD higher heart rate), although none of the confidence
intervals exceeded one (see Figure~\ref{fig-ADD_PRO_risk_by_hour} D).
Across all hours, there was a plausible association between SDNN and
heart failure. However, this association disappeared after adjusting for
physical acceleration and heart rate (see
Figure~\ref{fig-ADD_PRO_risk_by_hour} B). In contrast, heart rate
between 10 PM and 9 AM was associated with heart failure (IRR range:
1.37 to 1.58 per SD higher heart rate) (see
Figure~\ref{fig-ADD_PRO_risk_by_hour} E). SDNN was consistently
associated with all-cause mortality across all hours, with a stronger
inverse association observed between 12 PM and 1 AM (IRR range: 0.79 to
0.88 per SD higher SDNN) (see Figure~\ref{fig-ADD_PRO_risk_by_hour} C).
No clear trends of association were observed between heart rate and
all-cause mortality.

In study III, 179 participants with type 2 had measures of NT-proBNP and

participants (36\% among those with valid CAN measurements
(Figure~\ref{fig-CAN} A)). Meanwhile, 24\% (n = 43) were unable to
complete the CART assessment adequately, primarily due to irregular
heart rhythms (n = 8) or insufficient air pressure during the Valsalva
manoeuvre (n = 21). Compare to those without CAN, the participants with
CAN were more women (41 \% vs 33 \%), were more sedentary (45\% vs
36\%), had a higher proportion with prior major CVD (41\% vs 20\%) and
declined eGFR (\textless{} 60) (36\% vs 22\%), higher levels of
triglyceride (median 2.05 mmol/L vs 1.95 mmol/ L), were slightly older

years vs 15 years), and higher use SGTL2-inhibitors (65\% vs 60\%) but
lower use of GLP-1 RA (63\% vs 70\%). No other difference in clinical
characteristic was observed.

\hypertarget{can-and-indicators-of-heart-failure}{%
\subsection{CAN and indicators of heart

A greater proportion of individuals with CAN exhibited elevated
NT-proBNP levels (\textgreater125 pg/ml) (51.9\%, n=52/78) compared to
those without CAN (23.2\%, n=26/112)(Figure~\ref{fig-CAN} E). The fully
adjusted odds ratio (OR) for elevated NT-proBNP in individuals with CAN
was 5.69 (95\% CI: 1.95; 18.49) relative to those without CAN. Among the
cardiovascular autonomic reflex tests (CART), the Valsalva maneuver
demonstrated the strongest association with NT-proBNP (OR 9.00, 95\% CI:
2.88; 33.09; n=51/75), followed by deep breathing (OR 3.30, 95\% CI:
1.17; 9.77; n=33/133) and orthostatic hypertension (OR 4.04, 95\% CI:
1.27; 13.77; n=24/146). No significant association was identified for
the lying-to-standing test (OR 0.80, 95\% CI: 0.32; 1.97; n=54/108).
After imputing missing CART data, the OR for CAN in relation to elevated
NT-proBNP declined to 2.94 (95\% CI: 1.37; 6.56). Sensitivity analyses,
which excluded participants using beta-blockers or those with a history
of CVD, resulted in a smaller sample size and wider confidence
intervals, though the overall association remained unchanged. CAN was
associated with elevated NT-proBNP in individuals both without (NYHA I;
OR = 4.3, 95\% CI: 1.1; 16.3) and with heart failure symptoms (NYHA ≥
II; OR = 16.4, 95\% CI: 1.2; 222.0), though the interaction was not
significant (p = 0.4). Similar associations were seen across WATCH-DM
risk groups: very-low-to-moderate (OR = 6.1, 95\% CI: 1.6; 23.5) and
high-to-very-high (OR = 6.3, 95\% CI: 0.83; 46.9). Participants with CAN
had 1.7 (95\% CI: 0.3 to 3.0) point higher WATCH-DM risk score compared
to those without CAN. The OR of presenting with NYHA class II or higher
was 5.51 (95\% CI: 1.9 to 15.97) in the group with CAN.

\chapter{Discussion}\label{discussion}}

The aim of this dissertation is to understand how cardiovascular
autonomic dysfunction and CAN affect the risk of CVD across stages of
glucose metabolism. Given the rising prevalence of prediabetes and T2D,
and their association with increased risks of CVD and heart failure,
there is a pressing need for earlier indicators to help healthcare
providers intervene in a timely manner and prevent progression to more
advanced stages of cardiovascular complications. One promising approach
involves leveraging data from wearable devices and standardized
screening tools. Heart rate dynamics and variability across different
circumstances may hold promise as accessible indicators for early
cardiovascular risk stratification.

This chapter presents a summary of the main findings from this
dissertation, interpreted in the context of existing evidence in the
field, and discusses their clinical relevance across different levels of
healthcare. Moreover, the strengths and limitations of the methods and
results will be discussed.

\section{Summary of findings}\label{summary-of-findings}}

In this dissertation, autonomic dysfunction, defined by long-term HRV
and standardized CARTs, and its relationship with cardiovascular
complications were studied across three different cohorts representing
populations at varying levels of prevention and care, including public
health, primary care, and secondary care. In the Maastricht study (Study
I), I investigated autonomic dysfunction, measured by 24-hour HRV, and
arterial stiffness, assessed dynamically at the aortic site and locally
at the carotid site among individuals with normal glucose metabolism,
prediabetes, and T2D. Lower HRV was associated with higher aortic and
carotid stiffness. This association was evident regardless of glucose
metabolism status, and was more pronounced in individuals with
prediabetes or T2D. While no significant difference was observed between
prediabetes and T2D, the association was modified by HbA1c after
excluding individuals with T2D, supporting the modifying effect of
dysglycemia. Z-scores of time- and frequency-domain measures showed the
strongest associations, primarily driven by HRV indices reflecting total
variation in interbeat intervals (SDNN, SDANN, SDNN index, ULF, VLF,
TP).

Following Study I, I focused on individuals at higher risk of developing
diabetes, using data from the ADDITION-PRO (Study II) cohort of
individuals representing high-risk individuals of diabetes. In study II,
per lower SD in SDNN, measured over a multiple days, was associated with
18\%, 24\%, and 21\% higher risk for ischemic-related CVD,
hospitalization of heart failure, and all-cause mortality, respectively.
The risk became higher at SDNN levels below 120 ms, supported by a
greater difference in incidence rates between individuals with 100 ms
and 120 ms than the difference observed between individuals with 120 ms
and 160 ms. Hourly measures suggested a specific time point related to
ischemic-related CVD, as lower SDNN recorded between 6:00 and 7:00 AM
was associated with MACE. Residual adjustment of concurrent heart rate
and physical movement did not explain the observed association. Hourly
SDNN was associated with all-cause MRR, although no specific time point
showed an exceptionally strong association. While no association between
hourly SDNN and heart failure was observed, higher heart rate during the
night hours from 02:00 to 06:00 AM was linked to an increased risk of
heart failure hospitalization.

Our findings suggest that both long-term HRV measures and hourly HRV
responses may serve as indicators of CVD risk. However, a key limitation
is that long-term HRV was assessed under free-living conditions, which
restricts the ability to perform standardized tests of autonomic
function. In the CANCAN study (study III), I used standardized CARTs to
define CAN and describe indicators of heart failure, defined by elevated
NT-proBNP, WATCH-DM risk, and NYHA classification among those with and
without CAN in a population with T2D. In CANCAN, two out five had CAN.
Compared to individuals without CAN, theses individual more often showed
signs of heart failure, including elevated NT-proBNP levels, higher
WATCH-DM risk score, and higher classifications on the NYHA. CAN was
association elevated NT-proBNP levels and the persisted even among
individuals without heart failure symptoms based on NYHA classification,
as well as those categorized as having low to moderate heart failure
risk according to the WATCH-DM score.

In summary, various aspects of autonomic dysfunction and cardiovascular
complications were investigated in populations with normal glucose
metabolism, prediabetes, and T2D.The overall findings showed that
autonomic function, assessed through heart rate dynamics of long-term
HRV and diurnal HRV and heart rate responses, is associated with an
increased risk of CVD and heart failure. This relationship appears to be
stronger in more severe stages of dysglycemia. Moreover, among
individuals with T2D, the presence of CAN may help identify those at
higher risk of heart failure, even in the absence of heart failure
symptoms.

\section{Cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction and its impact on heart
disease across glucose
metabolism}\label{cardiovascular-autonomic-dysfunction-and-its-impact-on-heart-disease-across-glucose-metabolism}}

This dissertation show that cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction,
measured by HRV and CARTs, is associated with CVD risk across the
spectrum of glucose metabolism dysregulation. This association is
evident with measures of arteriosclerosis, atherosclerotic events,
all-cause mortality, and heart failure in individuals at high risk of
diabetes, as well as with indications of heart failure in patients with
T2D.

\hypertarget{arteriosclerosis-1}{%
\subsubsection{Arteriosclerosis}\label{arteriosclerosis-1}}

In Study I, autonomic dysfunction, measured by 24-hour HRV, showed to be
associated with arterial stiffness, assessed both dynamically (cf-PWV)
and locally (CD). This suggests that autonomic responses under
free-living conditions contribute to the development of arterial
stiffness. Majority of studies have shown an association between
autonomic dysfunction, as measured by short-term HRV during rest, and
arterial stiffness in populations with either type 1 or
T2D\textsuperscript{62}. Study I extended this perspective by long-term
HRV and including a population without diabetes or prediabetes.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=4in,height=\textheight]{images/hrv_arterial_stiffness.pdf}

}

\caption{Autonomic dysfunction and arterial stiffness. (Source: Author).

\end{figure}

Arterial stiffness is not only a structural marker of vascular ageing
but is also dynamically modulated by local endothelial signals and
autonomic nervous system activity. Several studies have demonstrated a
link between elevated sympathetic tone and increased arterial
stiffness{[}\textsuperscript{63}{]}\textsuperscript{64}. Two possible
mechanisms may explain how autonomic dysfunction is related to arterial
stiffness. First, autonomic dysfunction may increase the vascular tone
of large arteries, thereby impairing arterial elasticity. This concept
is supported by animal studies. In rats, proper autonomic regulation has
been shown to be essential for maintaining aortic elasticity.
Conversely, chronic overstimulation of sympathetic activity can lead to
structural remodeling and increased arterial stiffness. Therefore,
although the initial effects of autonomic dysfunction are dynamic and
amenable to change by intervention, they may become progressively less
reversible over time. While such findings cannot be directly
extrapolated to humans, they suggest plausible biological pathways.
Second, the autonomic nervous system regulates heart rate and cardiac
contractility. Autonomic dysfunction typically manifests as both reduced
HRV and elevated resting heart rate. Arterial shear stress increases as
a result of heightened sympathetic activity and parasympathetic
withdrawal. A higher resting heart rate may contribute to structural
stiffer arteries by altering blood flow dynamics and increasing shear
stress. Our earlier study using data from the Whitehall II cohort showed
that a steeper decrease in short-term (5-minute) HRV over a ten-year
period was linked with higher levels of aortic stiffness in the
subsequent five years\textsuperscript{65}.

The association between 24-hour HRV and arterial stiffness was modified
by dysglycemia, suggesting dysclycemia introduce CAN that can affect
arterial stiffness, even before the onset of
T2D{[}\textsuperscript{66}{]}\textsuperscript{67}\textsuperscript{68}.
Data from the Whitehall II study showed that aortic stiffness increased
more steeply with higher HbA1c values among non-diabetic
individuals\textsuperscript{69}. In the subpopulation in Study I without
diabetes, a modification by HbA1c in both aortic and carotid stiffness
was observed. The modifying effect of HbA1c suggests that hyperglycaemia
amplifies the consequences of autonomic dysfunction.

\hypertarget{atherosclerosis-1}{%
\subsubsection{Atherosclerosis}\label{atherosclerosis-1}}

In Study II, I showed that individuals with a preclinical stage of
autonomic dysfunction, measured by multiday HRV, face a higher risk of
incident ischemic CVD, heart failure, and all-cause mortality.

We assessed week-long HRV to capture autonomic activity in real-life
settings across several days. Our results are consistent with earlier
research linking reduced HRV to cardiovascular outcomes and
mortality\textsuperscript{5}. Our findings build on existing evidence by
(1) focusing on a population at elevated risk of diabetes, (2) utilizing
multiday HRV recordings, and (3) identifying specific daily periods
where HRV patterns were indicative of ischemic-related CVD risk. By
using both week-long and hourly data, we identified specific periods of
higher risk. A strength of using multiday HRV recordings, is to provide
more robust insights into individual autonomic patterns by averaging
cardiovascular responses across typical daily conditions. This reduces
the influence of random fluctuations caused by factors such as physical
activity, emotional states, or sleep on any single
day\textsuperscript{70}.

Multiple mechanisms may explain how autonomic dysfunction contributes to
the initiation and progression of ischemic events and stroke. First, as
discussed in Study I, autonomic dysfunction may promote
arteriosclerosis, leading to arterial stiffness through a dynamic and
potentially modifiable process. Arterial stiffness impairs vasodilation,
increasing hemodynamic stress and the risk of plaque rupture and
thrombus formation {[}\textsuperscript{71}{]}\textsuperscript{72}. In
this context, findings from Study I may not entirely distinguish between
arterial stiffness and atherosclerosis, as shown by data from the
Rotterdam Study\textsuperscript{73}. As plaques develop, the associated
increase in sympathetic nerve density around the arteries could
transiently reduce vascular tone which over time reduce arterial
elasticity\textsuperscript{74}. In a smaller study of people with T2D,
lower HRV was linked with increased carotid
atherosclerosis\textsuperscript{75}.

Second, the autonomic nervous system innervates the adventitia layer of
blood vessels, where it modulates vascular tone via sympathetic fibres.
Although atherosclerotic plaques form in the intima layer, recent in
vivo studies have demonstrated that increased plaque burden is
associated with higher local sympathetic nerve density, likely mediated
by neuroinflammatory processes. Notably, reducing sympathetic
innervation has been shown to attenuate plaque formation in animal
models\textsuperscript{76}. These findings suggest that autonomic
dysfunction may not only reflect but also actively contribute to
atherogenesis.

Third, autonomic nervous dysfunction has been shown to interfere with
signalling pathways controlling heart rhythm, potentially leading to
arrhythmias that disturb cardiac contraction. Data from the
Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study illustrated that lower
short-term HRV was associated with incident atrial fibrillation over 20
years, with a higher risk among participants with
T2D\textsuperscript{77}. This supports the role of autonomic dysfunction
in arrhythmogenesis, which increases the risk of myocardial infarction
and stroke. However, in Study II, I did not include incident atrial
fibrillation as an outcome. We did not include atrial fibrillation as an
outcome in Study II due to limitations in Danish registries, which often
do not distinguish between short- and long-term AF, affecting diagnostic
validity. Future research is needed to explore whether it could explain
the higher risk of major adverse cardiovascular events.

A study of individuals with coronary artery disease showed that
stress-induced HRV was associated with myocardial infarction, even more
than resting HRV, suggesting that reduced parasympathetic modulation of
heart rate under stress may play a role in ischemia\textsuperscript{78}.
Our study focused on long-term HRV under free-living conditions,
capturing stress-responsive periods such as morning awakening. These
recordings likely reflect underlying autonomic dynamics relevant to
cardiovascular risk. A Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) in the UK
biobank of short-term HRV support this by identifying mechanisms
involving G-protein signaling, pacemaker activity, and mitochondrial
function. These pathways influence vagal control, cardiac excitability,
and energy metabolism\textsuperscript{79}. Although derived from
short-term recordings, the genetic associations may reflect autonomic
traits that persist across different time scales, thereby reinforcing
the biological basis of HRV. A Mendelian randomization study using data
from the Rotterdam Study found that genetically predicted HRV was
associated with an increased risk of atrial
fibrillation\textsuperscript{80}. However, this association did not
extend to all-cause mortality or cardiovascular death in the UK Biobank
cohort, where only phenotypically measured HRV showed a significant
relationship with these outcomes\textsuperscript{81}. Interestingly, the
genetic determinants of HRV exhibited pleiotropic relationships with
several autonomic traits, including resting heart rate, heart rate
response during exercise, and post-exercise recovery
dynamics\textsuperscript{81}. No GWAS has been conducted for long-term
HRV. Therefore, it is unclear whether the genetic influences identified
for short-term HRV are applicable to long-term HRV. Future GWAS efforts
targeting long-term HRV could help establish causal relationships by
leveraging methods such as Mendelian randomization, thereby advancing
our understanding of the genetic architecture underlying autonomic
regulation.

\hypertarget{heart-failure-1}{%
\subsubsection{Heart failure}\label{heart-failure-1}}

The relationship between cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction and heart
failure is complex\textsuperscript{82}. On one hand, autonomic
dysfunction contributes to cardiac remodelling and eventual heart
failure. On the other hand, it may reflect compensatory mechanisms of
the progression of cardiac remodelling and declining cardiac output. Our
findings demonstrated a relationship between autonomic dysfunction and
heart failure both cross-sectionally in a population with T2D and
prospectively in individuals representing different tiers of diabetes
risk. However, our data are limited in determining the extent to which
this relationship supports one explanation over the other, as we lack
baseline and follow-up measures of both heart failure and HRV. Earlier
studies have demonstrated that both short-term and long-term HRV are
associated with incident heart failure in populations with and without
T2D.{[}\textsuperscript{83}{]}\textsuperscript{84}{[}\textsuperscript{85}{]}\textsuperscript{86}.
Beyond examining a population at elevated risk of diabetes using
multiday HRV recordings, we expanded previous research by (1) unmasking
the role of resting heart rate in the relationship between HRV and heart
failure risk, and (2) identifying specific times of day when heart rate
patterns signaled higher risk of heart failure.

Several mechanisms may underlie the role of autonomic dysfunction in
advancing heart failure. Findings from Study I confirmed the
relationship between autonomic dysfunction and arterial stiffness. It is
well established that arterial stiffness is linked to cardiac
remodelling, as increased cf-PWV leads to an earlier return of the
reflected pulse wave to the aorta, which increases cardiac afterload and
reduces coronary perfusion pressure\textsuperscript{87}. Therefore,
autonomic dysfunction may have an indirect effect on heart failure,
potentially mediated by arterial stiffness. However, structured analyses
are needed to confirm these pathways. For example, through mediation
analysis to assess the direct and indirect effects of arterial
stiffness, with autonomic dysfunction as the main determinant. In Study
II, I observed that multiday HRV was associated with incident heart
failure, and approximately one-fourth of the risk was explained by
resting heart rate. Data from the Rotterdam Study showed that short-term
HRV was longitudinally associated with echocardiographic measures
reflecting systolic function, suggesting that autonomic dysfunction
contributes to cardiac remodelling\textsuperscript{88}. In contrast to
MACE outcomes, findings from Study II showed no specific time point in
hourly HRV that was associated with heart failure. Instead, it was the
overall daily pattern captured by multiday HRV that was linked to heart
failure risk. This suggests that the association is not driven by
isolated shifts in autonomic activity, but rather by a consistently
impaired autonomic balance under free-living conditions. The effect
appears to be driven in part by a failure to show appropriate decreases
in heart rate during rest, as individuals with higher hourly heart rates
at night had an increased risk of heart failure. In Study III, I
observed that individuals with CAN had higher risk of elevated levels of
NT-proBNP, a biomarker of myocardial stress and early heart failure.
Therefore, CAN is associated with hemodynamic consequences that
contribute to both structural and functional cardiac remodeling, which
in turn leads to elevated NT-proBNP levels.

We cannot exclude the possibility that autonomic dysfunction represents
an elevated demand for compensatory mechanisms as heart failure
progresses. Studies have shown that patients with heart failure and
lower HRV tend to have a worse prognosis in terms of mortality. If low
HRV or the presence of CAN were primarily driven by existing cardiac
complications, it would suggest that individuals with these conditions
exhibit more pronounced sympathetic overactivity as a consequence of
heart failure progression, indicating potential reverse causation.
Hence, elevated sympathetic activity during rest may reflect a greater
reliance on compensatory mechanisms to maintain cardiac output. More
precise measures are needed to assess whether sympathetic activity acts
as a primary driver of heart failure or as a secondary compensatory
response to cardiac dysfunction. In addition, it remains unclear to what
extent the parasympathetic nervous system can act as a protective
mechanism to counterbalance sympathetic dominance, and whether a decline
in HRV reflects a breakdown of this balance. The two pathways (autonomic
neuropathy and cardiac remodelling) are not mutually exclusive and may
interact in a reinforcing cycle. Autonomic dysfunction can lead to
increased sympathetic tone and reduced parasympathetic modulation,
placing the heart under chronic stress and promoting structural and
functional changes\textsuperscript{23}. In turn, cardiac remodelling may
impair autonomic regulation, further exacerbating the imbalance. This
interplay may create a self-perpetuating loop that accelerates the
progression of heart failure. However, this remains beyond the scope of
our current data and analysis.

\hypertarget{clinical-implications}{%
\section{Clinical implications}\label{clinical-implications}}

The dissertation investigates autonomic dysfunction in populations
ranging from normal glucose metabolism to T2D and yields insights
relevant for individuals engaged at different levels of the healthcare
system. No specific role has yet been defined for autonomic dysfunction
in clinical decision-making within healthcare, as current treatment and
intervention options remain limited. Despite the fact that the results
do not extend to the implementation of autonomic dysfunction in clinical
practice, the findings from three included cohorts representing
populations under public health, primary care, and secondary care. They
mark a notable first step in addressing the impact of autonomic
dysfunction on cardiovascular complications. In following section, the
clinical implications of using autonomic dysfunction in the prevention
of CVD will be discussed. If long-term HRV or CARTs are to be considered
for improving risk stratification, it is important to determine at what
stage in the progression of diabetes risk, and at which level of care,
autonomic dysfunction becomes meaningful for early detection and
intervention.

\hypertarget{public-health}{%
\subsection{Public health}\label{public-health}}

A central strategy in preventing CVD is the early identification and
treatment of individuals at high risk\textsuperscript{89}. Public health
initiatives support this by promoting healthy lifestyles, facilitating
early screening for risk factors, and improving access to essential care
and medications. Long-term HRV may enhance these efforts by identifying
individuals with elevated cardiovascular risk and by tracking their
physiological response to lifestyle changes.

Evidence from Study I showed that lower long-term HRV was associated
with increased arterial stiffness, as measured by cf-PWV and CD, even in
individuals without T2D. One standard deviation lower HRV corresponded
to the effect of 2.7 additional years on cf-PWV and 1.6 years on
CD\textsuperscript{90}. These cross-sectional findings suggest that HRV
may serve as a marker of early vascular aging and cardiovascular risk.
Supporting this, the Whitehall II study demonstrated a longitudinal
relationship between short-term HRV and aortic stiffness. Together,
these findings highlight the potential of HRV as a dynamic indicator of
vascular health.

Within the public health setting, individuals with prediabetes represent
a particularly vulnerable group at risk for
comorbidities\textsuperscript{91}. They often fall between structured
care pathways, sometimes receiving regular follow-up and other times
remaining outside formal healthcare systems. Notably, Studies I and II
demonstrated that the associations between long-term HRV and CVD risk
were especially pronounced in this population. In those at high risk of
diabetes, a one standard deviation (33 ms) decrease in multiday SDNN was
equivalent to 4.5 additional years of aging for major adverse
cardiovascular events and 2.2 to 2.4 years for heart
failure\textsuperscript{92}. On a population level, lower HRV (SDNN: 100
ms) in individuals with prediabetes was associated with a higher
incidence rate of CVD, heart failure, and all-cause mortality compared
to individuals with normal-to-higher HRV (SDNN: 120--160 ms). These
findings reinforce the role of HRV as an early and sensitive marker of
cardiovascular health in populations at cardiometabolic risk.

While these findings highlight HRV's potential, practical implementation
faces several challenges. Historically, long-term HRV monitoring has
required specialized equipment such as Holter ECG recorders. However,
the growing popularity of wearable devices offers a promising
alternative. These devices provide a non-invasive, user-friendly way to
collect heart rate and HRV data over time\textsuperscript{11}.

If HRV monitoring proves effective in helping individuals maintain a
healthy, age-adjusted HRV range through lifestyle changes and prompts
healthcare engagement when HRV deteriorates, it could become a
meaningful tool for long-term health tracking. A cross-sectional study
of 8 million individuals found that those who took more steps per day
had higher HRV\textsuperscript{13}, suggesting that HRV may also reflect
behavioral adaptation.

A major public health challenge lies in ensuring equitable access to
wearable technology. Individuals from lower socioeconomic backgrounds
are significantly less likely to own such devices, raising concerns
about health disparities. Despite this, there is encouraging evidence
that the general population is receptive to digital health innovations.
Many are willing to share health data with public institutions and
support the use of AI in disease
monitoring{[}\textsuperscript{11}{]}\textsuperscript{93}.

Integrating wearable HRV monitoring into public health strategies could
represent a transformative step in proactive cardiovascular care. It may
support early detection, personalized prevention, and timely referral to
primary care when risk levels increase.

\hypertarget{primary-care}{%
\subsection{Primary care}\label{primary-care}}

Cardiovascular risk in primary care is assessed using clinical
evaluations and standardized risk prediction tools to identify
individuals at elevated risk (ref.). Management focuses on lifestyle
modification, pharmacological therapy, and regular monitoring to reduce
cardiovascular events (ref.). In this context, long-term HRV may offer
added value by improving the precision of cardiovascular risk
stratification and by serving as a marker to monitor the effectiveness
of preventive strategies.

Long-term HRV may enhance individual risk classification when added to
established clinical risk scores. Tools such as SCORE2 and the
Framingham Risk Score are widely used in primary care to guide
cardiovascular risk assessment\textsuperscript{94,95}. In Study I,
models adjusted for conventional CVD risk factors supported the
potential added value of 24-hour HRV in relation to arterial stiffness,
a surrogate marker of CVD risk. Study II extended this perspective by
demonstrating associations between multiday HRV and incident CVD and
heart failure. However, these findings are based on associations and do
not include formal prediction modeling\textsuperscript{96}. A limitation
of our studies is that we did not evaluate whether incorporating
long-term HRV or CARTs into existing risk scores improves predictive
performance beyond current guidelines. While most biomarkers have shown
limited incremental value beyond established predictors (including age,
sex, lipid profiles, diabetes status, and blood pressure), some studies
suggest that 24-hour HRV may improve risk discrimination for CVD and
all-cause mortality in individuals with T2D\textsuperscript{97}, and for
stroke and heart failure in older
adults{[}\textsuperscript{83}{]}\textsuperscript{98}. However, these
studies often lack calibration or validation in large-scale cohorts and
have not been integrated with widely used risk scores such as SCORE2 or
the Framingham Risk Score.

Long-term HRV may also help identify preclinical autonomic dysfunction,
enabling targeted interventions in a subgroup of patients to prevent
CVD. The increasing availability of wearable devices capable of
capturing long-term HRV data presents a practical opportunity for
continuous monitoring in primary care. These devices may facilitate
earlier detection of autonomic dysfunction and support more personalized
approaches to cardiovascular risk management. However, the clinical
utility of stratifying patients based on preclinical autonomic
dysfunction remains uncertain. These considerations are only actionable
if interventions in this subgroup can be shown to reduce cardiovascular
risk. Emerging evidence suggests that both pharmacological and lifestyle
interventions can improve HRV in the short term\textsuperscript{99,100}.
For example, high-intensity interval training has been shown to improve
autonomic function in obese individuals with and without
T2D\textsuperscript{101}. Similarly, lifestyle changes in individuals
with prediabetes have been associated with improvements in short-term
HRV, which may partly explain a reduction in diabetes risk independently
of weight loss\textsuperscript{102}. Nevertheless, it remains unclear
whether these effects on HRV are sustainable over time and whether they
translate into long-term cardiovascular protection. In many cases,
improvements in autonomic function may be mediated indirectly through
changes in cardiometabolic markers such as glucose levels, lipid
profiles, body weight, maximal oxygen uptake, and blood pressure.

Despite these uncertainties, monitoring autonomic function through
long-term HRV may offer a valuable tool for assessing cardiovascular
risk and tracking the impact of preventive strategies. In Denmark,
prediabetes, defined by HbA1c, is present in 7.1\% of
adults\textsuperscript{103}. One in five of these individuals develops
T2D within five years\textsuperscript{103}, while others either remain
in the prediabetic stage or return to normoglycemia. Despite their
increased risk of CVD and heart failure\textsuperscript{104},
individuals with prediabetes are not captured by existing preventive
strategies. This underscores the need for early and precise risk
assessment\textsuperscript{10}. Given that the cardiovascular
consequences of autonomic dysfunction appear to be more pronounced in
individuals with prediabetes compared to those with normoglycemia, HRV
has the potential to help identify those at elevated CVD risk within
this group. However, evidence demonstrating improved risk prediction and
sustained effects leading to better cardiovascular outcomes is needed to
establish its relevance for integration into primary care.

\hypertarget{secondary-care}{%
\subsection{Secondary care}\label{secondary-care}}

In secondary care, endocrinologists assess cardiovascular and heart
failure risk by integrating advanced diagnostics, biomarker analysis,
and imaging to detect early dysfunction. The treatment of patients with
T2D is guided by evidence-based therapies and multidisciplinary
collaboration. The ADA/EASD 2022 consensus on Management of
Hyperglycemia in T2D emphasizes that early detection of heart failure in
individuals with T2D is crucial, as it enables timely initiation of
therapies such as SGLT2 inhibitors, which have demonstrated significant
benefits in reducing heart failure-related
outcomes\textsuperscript{105}. A major challenge in diabetes care is
detecting heart failure before symptoms appear, as patients with
symptomatic heart failure face a higher risk of mortality and more
frequent hospitalizations\textsuperscript{4}. The AHA, ACC, and HFSA
2022 guidelines recommend identifying individuals at risk of heart
failure based on factors such as diabetes, poor glycaemic control,
uncontrolled hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, elevated BMI, albuminuria,
renal dysfunction, and a history of CVD\textsuperscript{106}. Still,
there is a need to identify optimal approaches for recognizing and
diagnosing heart failure in clinical care, as broad echocardiographic
screening in T2D is time-consuming and costly\textsuperscript{4}.

Study III demonstrated that CAN may help identify individuals at
increased risk of heart failure, beyond what is captured by symptoms or
existing risk scores. Our findings support considering CAN as a relevant
risk factor for heart failure and suggest it may have value in future
risk stratification strategies in T2D. A clinical advantage of using
CARTs is that they are standardized tests performed under controlled
conditions. CARTs has proven to be reliable and reproducible, with
reference values established in large population
studies\textsuperscript{47}. Beyond these findings and the established
evidence of increased heart failure risk, CAN in the T2D population also
identifies individuals at high risk for overall CVD, kidney disease, and
early mortality{[}\textsuperscript{107}{]}\textsuperscript{108}. In
Study III, I observed that two out of five participants had CAN,
highlighting it as a prevalent complication. Therefore, detecting CAN
may uncover an often-overlooked condition that is common in individuals
with T2D.

Clinical stratification of care includes two key considerations: (1) CAN
should be further evaluated for associated cardiovascular complications,
such as heart failure; and (2) cardiopreventive strategies should be
initiated earlier in this subgroup.

First, patients with CAN may benefit from further cardiovascular
assessment, including the use of sensitive biomarkers or
echocardiography. NT-proBNP is a strong predictor of heart failure and a
validated biomarker for ruling out the condition (ref.). However, its
specificity varies across heart failure phenotypes, being less specific
for detecting HFpEF compared to HFrEF. Therefore, additional evaluation
using echocardiography may be warranted. Beyond classify heart failure
phenotypes, echocardiography identifies preclinical stages of heart
failure through the detection of functional or structural cardiac
abnormalities. Including CAN in structured assessments of heart failure
could help clarify to which extent does CAN overlap with cardiac
abnormalities. Determining the diagnostic and prognostic value of CAN,
particularly its sensitivity and specificity in detecting HFrEF and
HFpEF, requires further investigation.

Second, the presence of CAN may justify earlier initiation of protective
therapies. SGLT2 inhibitors are recommended as second-line treatment in
T2D and have demonstrated benefits in reducing the risk of heart
failure, CVD, and kidney function decline, complications commonly
associated with CAN. Current guidelines recommend initiating these
therapies based on a history of CVD, heart failure, or the presence of
conventional high-risk cardiovascular factors. However, the specific
impact of SGLT2 inhibitors on the progression of cardiorenal outcomes in
patients with CAN remains to be fully understood. Furthermore, while
antihypertensive treatment is a cornerstone of cardiovascular risk
management, whether specific classes of antihypertensive agents offer
protective effects in patients with CAN remains to be explored.

The clinical implications of our findings in Study III are limited. The
generalizability of our results is restricted, as our study population
consisted of patients with T2D receiving secondary care. Two out of five
patients with CAN showed to have a history of CVD---a group already at
increased risk of heart failure due to their prior diagnosis. This
overlap may influence the interpretation of CAN as an independent risk
factor. Therefore, these findings need to be validated in a broader
population with T2D, including individuals without a history of CVD.
Doing so would allow for greater generalizability of our results to the
broader T2D population, particularly those visiting primary care.

\hypertarget{strengths-and-limitations}{%
\section{Strengths and limitations}\label{strengths-and-limitations}}

\hypertarget{study-design}{%
\subsection{Study design}\label{study-design}}

\emph{Cross-sectional design}

Studies I and III are based on cross-sectional data, with exposure and
outcome measured within a three-month period. The main limitation of
this design is that it does not allow us to determine whether the
exposure led to the outcome or vice versa. As a result, we cannot
establish temporality or confirm whether changes in the outcome were
caused by the exposure. Based on prior evidence, the direction of the
associations in Study I was inferred using physiological knowledge and
findings from epidemiological and in vivo studies\textsuperscript{65}.

Study III focused on the clinical diagnosis of CAN and the presence of
heart failure. The research question was oriented toward the clinical
utility of CAN in identifying patients with T2D who may be progressing
early toward heart failure. Whether cardiac function progressively
worsens due to the underlying mechanisms of CAN remains to be fully
established.

\emph{Longitudinal design}

A major strength of Study II is its longitudinal design, where HRV was
measured at baseline and outcomes were captured prospectively through
national registries. This temporal structure ensures that the exposure
(HRV) preceded the outcome, reducing the risk of reverse causation. The
prospective design allows for stronger inference of directionality than
cross-sectional studies. Furthermore, the use of high-quality registry
data ensures complete outcome ascertainment and minimizes loss to
follow-up bias.

Causality cannot be ascertained from the findings in Study I and Study
II, and more causally focused methods are needed. Mendelian
randomization, which uses genetic instruments for exposure, could help
address this question. Additionally, structured mediation analysis
involving modifications such as medication or lifestyle changes could
clarify whether improving HRV or CART reduces cardiovascular risk, using
data from intervention studies.

\hypertarget{internal-validity}{%
\subsection{Internal validity}\label{internal-validity}}

In this project, I aimed to assess cardiovascular autonomic function
both in free-living conditions and in response to standardized test
procedures during clinical visits. Additionally, I used dynamic
measurements to evaluate arterial stiffness both locally and by
velocity, and biomarker assessments to determine the presence of heart
failure. In this section, I discuss the validity of 24-hour, multiday,
and hourly HRV measurements, as well as the standardized tests of CAN. I
also address the validity of the included outcomes and discuss the
strengths and limitations of using MACE as a time-to-event outcome.

\subsubsection{Long-term HRV (\textgreater24 hours) as measurement for
autonomic
function}\label{long-term-hrv-24-hours-as-measurement-for-autonomic-function}}

{[}Further consideration is needed regarding the accuracy and relevance
of different HRV indices. In long-term HRV, indices sensitive to
respiration (such as RMSSD, HF, and pNN50) are more influenced by
behavioral factors and have shown weaker associations with metabolic and
cardiovascular outcomes compared to total variability measures (such as
SDNN, SDANN, TP, ULF, VLF, and
LF){[}\textsuperscript{44}{]}\textsuperscript{8}\textsuperscript{90}.
However, their utility may improve when measured during rest in short
segments, such as 5-minute recordings.{]} {[}Even if HRV proves to be
causally linked with cardiovascular complications, its measurement is
limited by the inability to distinguish between sympathetic and
parasympathetic contributions.{]}

A main consideration in HRV analysis is the reliability of raw
inter-beat interval data from ECG recordings. To ensure accurate various
HRV measures, the intervals must be captured in a continuous and
correctly sequenced manner. Frequency-domain analyses depend on the
integrity of the inter-beat interval sequence, while some time-domain
measures, such as RMSSD and pNN50, specifically quantify the variability
in the differences between successive intervals.

In Study I, data from a 12-lead Holter system was used, which is
considered the gold standard for long-term ECG recordings. With detailed
and sequential inter-beat intervals, all HRV metrics were calcualted.

In Study II, data from the Actiheart device was used for HRV. The device
was configured to record continuously over an 8-day period. It captured
30-second epochs of mean heart rate intervals, along with upper and
lower prediction intervals. From each epoch, I generated a distribution
of inter-beat intervals. An algorithm was applied to estimate HRV from
these distributions, and its validation showed strong agreement with
established metrics, including SDNN, SDANN, and the SDNN index
{[}\textsuperscript{6}{]}\textsuperscript{57}. However, a limitation of
this dataset is that it did not allow for the calculation of
frequency-domain measures or specific time-domain metrics such as RMSSD
or pNN50. HF power, RMSSD, and pNN50 typically show earlier diurnal
peaks compared to low-frequency power and SDNN\textsuperscript{13}.
These measures are more reflective of parasympathetic activity during
in- and expiration. It remains to be determined how these hourly
measures relate to CVD, heart failure, and all-cause mortality.

In the context of this study, which focuses on long-term HRV in
free-living conditions, it is important to acknowledge that the
autonomic nervous function we aim to assess may also be influenced by
behavioral factors such as physical activity, sleep, meal timing,
emotions, smoking, caffeine intake, alcohol consumption, medication use,
and prior cardiovascular complications. These factors can potentially
mask or mimic underlying physiological dysfunction during recordings,
but they can also elicit the HRV responses we are interested in.
Therefore, reduced long-term HRV cannot be interpreted solely as a
marker of autonomic function. HRV is also influenced by lifestyle
patterns over time, making it sensitive not only to day-to-day behaviors
but also to long-term habits that affect autonomic balance.

In Studies I and II, I accounted for habitual physical activity, and in
Study II, I also adjusted hourly HRV for physical movement during
recordings to test the influence of concurrent activity. However,
further studies are needed to understand how lifestyle patterns affect
long-term HRV recordings on subsequent days, in order to separate direct
behavioural from physiological components. In both studies, I excluded
participants with prior CVD to preserve the etiological order between
autonomic dysfunction and cardiovascular outcomes.

Anti-hypertensive medications, especially beta-blockers, are known to
increase HRV in randomized controlled trials\textsuperscript{109}.
However, in cohort studies, participants using anti-hypertensives
generally show lower HRV, likely reflecting a higher burden of
cardiovascular complications {[}ref{]}. Because beta-blockers target the
autonomic nervous system, they may introduce bias in HRV measurements by
interfering with the function. In sensitivity analyses in Studies I and
III, excluding participants on anti-hypertensive treatment did not
materially change the estimates. Therefore, these participants where
kept and adjusted for medication use in the full models.

HRV levels are influenced by heart rate, as lower resting heart rate
allows for greater variability. In Study I, I chose not to adjust for
heart rate in our models, as this could introduce multicollinearity.
Additionally, elevated heart rate is driven by increased sympathetic
activity and may act as a mediator in the pathway leading to arterial
stiffness. Our use of full-day recordings captures HRV during both rest
and activity, providing a robust representation of autonomic function
over a typical day. In contrast, heart rate correction may be more
relevant for short-term HRV recordings, where standardized conditions
can be affected by random influences such as time of day, smoking, or
caffeine intake. These factors would have been relevant in Study III had
I included HRV measures. In Study II, I usesd the residuals method to
pre-adjust HRV measures for resting heart rate, which accounted for part
of the observed associations, particularly with heart failure and
all-cause mortality, and to a lesser extent with ischemic-related CVD
events.Similar trends were observed for hourly associations, where heart
rate pre-adjustment had had comparable effects on the outcomes.

{[}When HRV is analyzed in shorter segments (e.g., hourly or in 5-minute
intervals), measures like RMSSD, pNN50, and HF appear to offer new
insights into autonomic function and its relevance in diabetes and CVD,
e.g during night-time {[}\textsuperscript{110}{]}\textsuperscript{99}.
SDANN and SDNNi aim to reduce the impact of short-term variability, such
as that caused by physical activity, by calculating either the standard
deviation of 5-minute segment mean IBI (SDANN) or the mean of standard
deviations across 5-minute segments (SDNNi). {[}include lower-frequency
points{]}. This helps smooth out transient fluctuations and better
capture long-term autonomic modulation. Thus, behavioral patterns pose a
limitation in physiological research aiming to disentangle the causal
pathways between autonomic dysfunction and CVD when using long-term HRV
measures. These patterns likely introduce high variability between
observations that is not attributable to autonomic function itself.{]}

CART provides a practical approach for screening for autonomic
dysfunction and has been shown to be a reliable
method\textsuperscript{111}. Although certain indices from CARTs may be
influenced by factors such as time of day or recent physical activity,
these effects are generally minimal. Furthermore, no impact of caffeine
intake has been observed on the reference age-based
formula\textsuperscript{47}. A limitation of the CARTs in this study was
the high prevalence of participants who were unable to complete the full
battery of tests, primarily due to missing data from the Valsalva
manoeuvre.

\hypertarget{selection-bias}{%
\subsubsection{Selection bias}\label{selection-bias}}

\textbf{The Maastricht Study}

The target population in Study I was intended to represent individuals
at different stages of glucose metabolism. However, our analysis may be
affected by selection bias in the representation of individuals with
T2D. The Maastricht Study recruited participants who were able and
willing to attend multiple research visits and receive personal health
feedback, which likely attracted health-conscious individuals with
higher education levels. As a result, participants with T2D were
relatively healthy, with a median disease duration of three years and a
low prevalence of complications. Those who completed both long-term ECG
and arterial stiffness assessments may represent an even healthier
subgroup. This selection bias may limit the generalizability of the
findings to the broader T2D population and could explain why the effect
modification did not differ step-wise from that observed in individuals
with prediabetes.

\textbf{ADDITION-PRO}

The target population in Study II was intended to represent individuals
at high risk of developing T2D. Participants were recruited through a
stepwise screening procedure. Initially, individuals were selected based
on a risk score derived from a self-administered questionnaire sent by
mail. Those with high scores were invited for further testing using
HbA1c or random glucose measurements.

This recruitment strategy involved selection by design, as it defined
the source population based on specific risk criteria. The questionnaire
prioritized risk factors such as older age and hypertension, leading to
overrepresentation of these groups\textsuperscript{112}. Prediabetes was
identified only after biochemical testing, while the risk score was
primarily designed to detect undiagnosed T2D. Although this selection
process was intentional and aligned with the ADDITION-PRO objectives, it
may limit the generalizability of the findings to the broader population
at risk for T2D.

In addition, selection bias may have occurred due to differential
participation in the ADDITION screening program. Healthier individuals
were more likely to participate, both by completing the risk
questionnaire and by attending follow-up testing\textsuperscript{113}.
As a result, the baseline risk for CVD in ADDITION-PRO participants may
have been lower compared to the broader target population.

\textbf{CANCAN}

The target population in Study III was intended to represent individuals
with type 2 diabetes treated in outpatient clinics. In Denmark, patients
with type 2 diabetes are referred to diabetes specialists at outpatient
clinics when their general practitioner is unable to stabilize their
condition. A strength of the CANCAN sampling strategy is that patients
were already attending endocrinology consultations, and the study
examination required only additional time during their visit, without
the need for extra transportation or appointments. Assessing selection
bias in this study is challenging, as inclusion depended on referral
practices by general practitioners\textsuperscript{114}. These practices
may vary individually, with differing thresholds for referring patients
to specialized care based on clinical judgment and patient
characteristics.

\hypertarget{generalisability}{%
\subsubsection{Generalisability}\label{generalisability}}

The generalisability of our findings is considered in the context of the
targeted recruitment strategies used in each study, which aimed to
include individuals across a spectrum of diabetes risk, from normal
glucose metabolism to established type 2 diabetes. As a result, the
findings are most applicable to populations with similar clinical
profiles and healthcare settings.

Studies I-III include individuals at high risk of diabetes and those
with T2D. Therefore, the associations between cardiovascular autonomic
dysfunction and cardiovascular outcomes or surrogate biomarkers are
relevant to individuals with some degree of diabetes risk and progressed
T2D. Study I suggests that the link between autonomic dysfunction and
cardiovascular risk, as measured by arterial stiffness, is also present
in individuals with normal glucose metabolism, though to a lesser
extent. This finding, supported by replication in the Whitehall II
cohort\textsuperscript{65}, indicates that the observed relationship may
extend beyond high-risk groups and into the general population. In study
III , participants represent a higher-risk diabetes group among Danish
diabetes patients, while more stable patients remain under general
practitioner care. Consequently, the prevalence of heart failure
indicators and CAN is likely higher in this selected group, than
patients managed in primary care, and thus limits extending our finding
to broader T2D populations.

By design, younger individuals with prediabetes or young-adult-onset
type 2 diabetes are underrepresented in our studies. This group may be
overlooked in current research and warrants further attention in future
studies\textsuperscript{103,115}. The applicability of our findings to
other countries may be influenced by differences in demographic
composition, risk factor distributions, healthcare systems, and stages
of economic development. These factors can affect both the prevalence of
diabetes and cardiovascular disease and the nature of their
associations. While our study populations were primarily of Nordic and
Western European descent, differences in ethnic composition are only one
of several factors that may influence external validity. These regions
also share relatively well-organized, publicly funded healthcare
systems, which may differ substantially from those in other parts of the
world and further affect the applicability of our findings.

\hypertarget{conclusion}{%
\chapter{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}}

This dissertation aimed to investigate how cardiovascular autonomic
dysfunction, assessed by 24-hour HRV and CARTs, is associated with
cardiovascular complications across different stages of glucose
metabolism. The findings support the hypothesis that cardiovascular
autonomic dysfunction is an early and independent marker of
cardiovascular risk.

Cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction was associated with higher arterial
stiffness not only in individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D), but also
in those with prediabetes and normal glucose metabolism. A particularly
pronounced association was observed in individuals with prediabetes,
where lower multiday HRV was leading to an higher risk of cardiovascular
disease, heart failure, and mortality. These findings suggest that
cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction may contribute to cardiovascular
complications even before the onset of T2D, potentially through a
modifying effect during the early stages of dysglycemia. In populations
with T2D, standardized CARTS identified individuals with CAN who were
had higher risk of heart failure, even when they were asymptomatic and
not classified as high risk by conventional clinical tools.

Early detection are important as CVD and heart failure leads to lower
life-expectancy and quality of life. This disserations demostrates
cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction potential as s clinically relevant
marker of cardiovascular risk across the full spectrum of glucose
metabolism, even in stages before onset of T2D. However, it remains
unclear whether this dysfunction plays a causal role or reflects
underlying pathophysiological processes. Further research is needed to
determine its clinical utility in risk stratification and its potential
as a target for intervention.

\hypertarget{perspective}{%
\chapter{Perspective}\label{perspective}}

We have investigated cardiovascular autonomic function ipact on
cardiovascular complications across different stages of glucose
metabolism. Based on our findings and conlcusions, we propose further
perspectives to define its role in research and healthcare from three
aspects: (1) continuous non-invasive health monitoring, (2) risk
stratification, and (3) identification as a causal and modifiable
marker.

\hypertarget{continuous-monitoring-of-cardiovascular-health}{%
\section{Continuous monitoring of cardiovascular
health}\label{continuous-monitoring-of-cardiovascular-health}}

Understanding when and how physiological signals reflect elevated CVD
risk is essential for developing early and effective prevention
strategies. Incorporating HRV into digital health solutions could
support personalized feedback mechanisms, enabling timely lifestyle or
therapeutic interventions and contributing to more adaptive and
preventive healthcare strategies. Wearable devices enable comprehensive
data collection on behavioral (e.g., sleep and physical activity) and
physiological (e.g., heart rate, ECG, temperature)
parameters\textsuperscript{116}. These devices offer a broader and more
feasible approach to long-term heart rate monitoring. Despite growing
interest in wearable-based monitoring, the integration of HRV into
routine cardiometabolic risk assessment remains limited.

Two key aspects highlight the potential applications of monitoring: (1)
identification of risk and (2) assessment of response to intervention.

\emph{Identification of risk}

Lower long-term HRV is a risk factor for CVD, associated with arterial
stiffness and clinical endpoints. Our findings indicate that specific
HRV and heart rate patterns under free-living conditions may enhance
early risk detection, independent of concurrent physical activity. For
improved risk assessment, future predictive models should move beyond
adjusting for physical activity as a confounder and instead integrate
multiple physiological signals, such as HRV responses to sleep and
activity patterns, to better capture dynamic health states. Machine
learning offers powerful tools to analyze complex raw time-series data,
including interbeat intervals and accelerometer signals, potentially
improving risk prediction beyond traditional HRV summary metrics.
However, the limited interpretability of these models remains a key
barrier to clinical adoption.

\emph{Assessment of response to intervention}

HRV represents a potential target for intervention, as low HRV may
reflect adverse lifestyle patterns. Behaviors such as disrupted sleep,
physical inactivity, and irregular meal timing can influence circadian
fluctuations in HRV (ref. sleep, activity)\textsuperscript{99}.
Pharmacological interventions also impact HRV: beta-blockers have been
shown to increase HRV, while GLP-1 receptor agonists may reduce it
{[}\textsuperscript{109}{]}\textsuperscript{117}.

\end{minipage}%

\end{figure}

Future research can leverage wearable devices to better understand how
behavioral and pharmacological factors influence HRV. This approach may
help identify effective lifestyle patterns or treatments that support
cardiovascular health through HRV modulation.

However, standardization and transparency across wearable device brands
remain a challenge for both research and clinical use. While
smartwatches offer convenient heart rate monitoring, their accuracy
varies due to reliance on photoplethysmography, which can be affected by
motion and other external factors, especially during physical activity
{[}\textsuperscript{118}{]}\textsuperscript{119}. Despite these
limitations, ongoing improvements in sensor technology and algorithm
calibration are likely to enhance the reliability of wearable-derived
HRV and heart rate data.

\hypertarget{risk-stratification-1}{%
\section{Risk-stratification}\label{risk-stratification-1}}

The distinct roles of long-term HRV and CART in cardiovascular risk
stratification remain to be fully established and warrant further
investigation. From a wearable technology standpoint, it is still
unclear whether HRV can serve as an early indicator of CVD risk when
incorporated into a risk score alongside simple, non-invasive markers
such as age, sex, and BMI. Additionally, its comparative value against
established CVD risk scores that include blood-based biomarkers and
blood pressure remains to be determined.

A key limitation of long-term HRV measurement is the lack of
standardization, as data collected under free-living conditions may be
influenced by daily behaviors, potentially affecting risk
classification. This highlights the need for standardized protocols. In
contrast, CART is a reliable, non-invasive method that typically takes
around 10 minutes to perform. A standardized and validated diagnosis of
CAN using CART may help identify individuals with T2D who are at
elevated risk of complications. However, the extent to which CAN
diagnosis predicts heart failure risk and applies to broader populations
with T2D or prediabetes remains to be clarified.

Our findings suggest that long-term HRV and CAN may serve as useful
markers for identifying individuals at elevated metabolic risk who could
benefit from targeted preventive strategies. Future research should
explore whether those classified as high-risk based on autonomic
dysfunction or CAN would benefit from earlier cardiovascular screening
or tailored interventions.

\hypertarget{effective-causal-modifiable-marker}{%
\section{Effective causal modifiable
marker}\label{effective-causal-modifiable-marker}}

Our findings support a potential etiological link between long-term HRV
and CVD risk, providing preliminary evidence for a causal relationship.
However, the observed association does not confirm causality, and
further research is needed to determine whether HRV directly influences
CVD outcomes. While randomized controlled trials are the gold standard
for establishing causality, isolating the direct effect of HRV is
particularly challenging. Interventions that affect HRV often do so
indirectly through changes in weight, inflammation, or insulin
sensitivity. Similarly, pharmacological treatments may improve HRV as a
secondary effect, such as through blood pressure reduction from
antihypertensive medications. This makes it difficult to determine
whether modifying HRV itself leads to improved cardiovascular outcomes.

To address these limitations, modern epidemiological methods such as
Mendelian randomization and structured causal mediation analysis offer
promising alternatives. These approaches can help infer causality from
observational data and estimate indirect effects using trial data.
Notably, no genome-wide association study has yet investigated the
genetic determinants of long-term HRV. Establishing such associations is
essential for understanding its genetic architecture and for using
genetic variants as unconfounded proxies to assess HRV's causal role in
CVD.

\end{minipage}%

\end{figure}

Future cardiometabolic intervention trials, whether focused on lifestyle
or pharmacological strategies, should, where feasible, include HRV
measurements. This would enable structured mediation analyses and help
determine whether modifying autonomic function leads to sustained
improvements in cardiovascular outcomes. Such evidence could clarify
whether interventions like antihypertensive medications or lifestyle
changes in physical activity, diet, and sleep can causally and
sustainably improve CVD risk through HRV modulation.

Denne afhandling undersøgte, om kardiovaskulær autonom dysfunktion er
forbundet med kardiovaskulære komplikationer hos personer med normal
glukosemetabolisme, prædiabetes og type 2-diabetes. Kardiovaskulær
autonom dysfunktion blev målt igennme hjeretrymevariabilitet (HRV) og
standardiserede kardiovaskulære autonome refleksundersøgelser (CARTs).
Blandt målingerne gav 24-timers HRV indsigt i den autonome balance og
døgnrytmens skift mellem sympatisk og parasympatisk aktivitet. Lavere
værdier var konsekvent forbundet med ugunstige kardiovaskulære udfald.

På tværs af tre studier blev autonom dysfunktion forbundet med højere
niveauer af arteriel stivhed, en højere forekomst af iskæmiske
hjertekarsygedom, hjertesvigt og dødelighed. Sammenhængen med arteriel
stivhed blev observeret på tværs af hele spektret af glukosemetabolisme
og var særligt forhøjet hos personer med prædiabetes, hvilket antyder,
at autonom dysfunktion. På baggrund af dette fokuserede det
efterfølgende studie på personer med høj risiko for at udvikle diabetes.
I denne population var kardiovaskulær autonom dysfunktion forbundet med
højere risiko for kardiovaskulær sygdom, hjertesvigt og dødelighed.

Kardiovaskulær autonom neuropati, defineret gennem abnormale CARTs, var
forbundet med en højere risiko for hjertesvigt hos individer med type 2
diabetes, selv hos personer uden symptomer. Disse fund tyder på, at
kardiovaskulær autonom dysfunktion kan fungere som en tidlig og
uafhængig markør for risikoen for hjertesvigt, især i populationer med
risiko for type 2-diabetes.

Afhandlingen konkluderer, at kardiovaskulær autonom dysfunktion er en
klinisk relevant risikofaktor, som bør tiltrække større opmærksomhed i
både forskning og klinisk praksis. Fremtidige studier bør undersøge, om
forbedring af autonom funktion kan reducere kardiovaskulær risiko, og om
målinger af autonom dysfunktion kan integreres i eksisterende
risikomodeller. Derudover er potentialet i smarture til kontinuerlig
overvågning og tidlig opsporing en mulighed, der kan vurderes i både
kliniske og generelle populationer.

This dissertation investigated whether cardiovascular autonomic
dysfunction is associated with cardiovascular complications in
individuals with normal glucose metabolism, prediabetes, and type 2
diabetes. Cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction was assessed using heart
rate variability and standardized cardiovascular autonomic reflex tests.
Among the measures, 24-hour heart rate variability reflected autonomic
balance and circadian shifts in sympathetic and parasympathetic
activity. Lower long-term heart rate variability was consistently
associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes.

Across three studies, autonomic dysfunction was linked to higher levels
of arterial stiffness, a higher incidence of ischemic cardiovascular
events, heart failure, and all-cause mortality. The association with
arterial stiffness was observed across the full spectrum of glucose
metabolism and was particularly pronounced in individuals with
prediabetes, suggesting that autonomic dysfunction may play a role early
in the pathophysiological process. Building on this, the subsequent
studies focused on individuals at high risk of developing diabetes. In
this population, cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction was associated
with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and
mortality.

Cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy, as identified through abnormal
cardiovascular reflex testing, was associated with a higher risk of
heart failure, even in individuals without symptoms. These findings
suggest that cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction may serve as an early
and independent marker of heart failure risk, particularly in
populations at risk of type 2 diabetes.

The dissertation concludes that cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction is
a clinically relevant risk factor that warrants further attention in
both research and clinical practice. Future studies should explore
whether improving autonomic function can reduce cardiovascular risk and
whether measures of autonomic dysfunction can be integrated into
existing risk models. Additionally, the potential of wearable
technologies for continuous monitoring and early detection is a
possibility to be evaluated in both clinical and general populations.
