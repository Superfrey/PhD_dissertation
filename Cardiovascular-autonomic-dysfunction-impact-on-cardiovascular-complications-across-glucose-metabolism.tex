The research presented in this dissertation was conducted during my PhD
studies at the Department of Public Health, Aarhus University, and Steno
Diabetes Center Aarhus, between 2022 and 2025. The project was supported
by the Department of Public Health at Aarhus University, Steno Diabetes
Center Aarhus, and the European Foundation for the Study of
Diabetes/Sanofi European Diabetes Research Programme in Diabetes
associated with Cardiovascular Disease. The aim was to better understand
the impact of cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction on heart disease in
individuals with diabetes. I am grateful for the opportunity to explore
how autonomic dysfunction can be demonstrated by investigating
variations in heart rate responses across different durations and
conditions to gain insights into cardiovascular risk, which remains
ongoing issue in current research. It is my hope that the findings of
this dissertation will contribute to a deeper understanding of the
clinical potential of long-term heart rate variability measures and
standardized cardiovascular autonomic tests in identifying individuals
at risk for cardiovascular disease across all stages of glucose
metabolism. In doing so, I hope this work contributes to the broader
effort of improving care for individuals at risk of developing diabetes,
as well as those already living with the condition.

Much of the work I have been involved in during my PhD is not fully
reflected in this dissertation. I would like to take this opportunity to
provide an overview and acknowledge the many collaborative establishment
that sprouted during my time as a PhD student.

In my work on diabetes epidemiology, I have been deeply curious about
the future methods in research. This led me to become a peripheral
member of the Hulman Lab, a group with an open heart and a strong
foundation in critical thinking, focused on machine learning and
clinical prediction. Together with Adam Hulman and Anders Isaksen, we
investigated how people perceive the use of artificial intelligence in
healthcare. On this project, I am grateful to Lasse Bjerg and Annelli
Sandbæk and rest of Health in Central Denmark (HICD) steering comitees
for integrating our questionnaire into their cohort. I also appreciate
Kasper Normann's help with prompt data management. This collaboration
resulted in one original research paper and two other submitted
manuscript based on wave 2022 and 2024 of data collection from the HICD
cohort.

We set out to extend the generalisability of the CANCAN findings to
populations without type 2 diabetes. This led us to use data from the
Lolland-Falster Health Study (LOFUS). I am deeply grateful to Randi
Jepsen for the collaboration on accessing the cohort and for her support
in getting the biobank samples analysed. The data is now ready for use
in the study. Further appreciation goes to Marie Mathilde Bjerg
Christensen, Christian Stevns Hansen, and Jesper Fleischer for updating
reference values for CARTs using LOFUS data and for generously sharing
their expertise on the measurements.

In my last year of the PhD is was lucky to exchange research environment
to Baker Heart and Diabetes Institute. I had the privilege of working
alongside a proficient team of epidemiologists consisting of PhD
students, postdoctoral researchers, and senior scientists, using data
from the PREDICT study involving patients with type 2 diabetes. I was
impressed by how closely research and clinical care are integrated.
Furthermore, their dedication to utilizing cohorts and organizing
multinational data resources was truly admirable. I would like to extend
a special thank to Professor Dianna Magliano, Senior Researcher Julian
Sacre, and Professor Jonathan Shaw for their valuable input on using
questionnaires to screen for heart failure subtypes and for helping to
shape a study that will be submitted soon.

This PhD journey has been a remarkable adventure. The best part has
undoubtedly been all the people I have met and worked with along the
way. I would like to express my deepest gratitude to colleagues,
collaborators, friends, and family for their support throughout this
journey and for making the ride both fun and exciting.

First and foremost, I would like to thank my main supervisor, Daniel
Witte. His unwavering support, thought-provoking challenges, and
brilliant guidance have kept me motivated to learn about diabetes
epidemiology throughout this journey. His ability to expand horizons in
research has been truly inspiring, and I am deeply grateful for the
opportunities to grow under his mentorship. I would like thank the rest
of the supervisor team. Lasse Bjerg for his methodological support, high
spirits and sharp minded, always cutting straight to the core of the
research. Signe T. Andersen for her guidance and support throughout the
design and data collection of the CANCAN study. As a non-clinician
researcher, it was eye-opening to witness the complex challenges of
diabetes consultations, and I admire her ability to understand each
patient. Christian Stevns Hansen for his prompt support and strong
physiological expertise.

Thank you to all my friends at Steno Diabetes Center Aarhus (SDCA) and
the Department of Public Health at Aarhus University who have supported
my project, inspired great discussions, and shared fun times: Adam,
Omar, Luke, Daniel I, Anders, Benjamin, Jie, Livie, Helene, Sidsel,
Manuel, Christian, and Ole-Emil.

In The Maastricht Study, I would like to thank Marleen van Greevenbroek,
Miranda Schram, Carla van der Kallen, and the rest of the team for
granting me access to the cohort and for showing me the data collection
facilities. Thanks to Marion Feijge for guiding me through the data. I
am also grateful to Professor Coen Stehouwer for his sharp insight and
deep expertise in diabetes epidemiology. In the ADDITION-PRO study, I
would like to thank Anne-Louise Bjerre and Søren Brage for their help in
explaining variables, and data manager Marianne at the Department of
Public Health for her generous support. In the CANCAN study, I would
like to acknowledge Henrik Holm Thomsen and Gitte Jensen for their help
with recruitment, and Anne Katrine Møller Gramstrup for extracting
clinical data for the study population. I am also deeply grateful to the
people who generously agreed to participate in the CANCAN study.

No adventure is truly exciting without cultural exchange---whether
through the lovely visits from Peter and Ieva at SDCA or by immersing
myself in new research environments. To Professor Dianna Magliano and
Professor Jonathan Shaw, thank you for including me in the Epidemiology
group at the Baker Heart and Diabetes Institute in Melbourne. It was a
truly enriching stay, both scientifically and socially. I would like to
extend my sincere thanks to Julian Sacre for his valuable support and
insightful contributions in deepening my understanding of the challenges
involved in diagnosing heart failure subtypes. To the PhD students and
post-docs at 7/11, Della, Forough, Elizabeth, Jedidiah, Lei, Mahtab,
Kanika and Joanna, thank you for making me feel so welcomed and giving
me a wonderful and fun experience of Melbourne.

To my brothers Esben and Jalte, thank you for putting up with me and for
helping me loosen up and have fun. To my parents, thank you for
supporting me throughout my life and for standing by me in every path I
have chosen. Much of my curiosity for applying mathematics and
statistics to understand the world stems from my grandfather, Ebbe
Schaarup, who spent countless hours teaching and inspiring me. A large
part of this work is dedicated to him. Last but not least, to my lovely
girlfriend Freja, thank you for always being kind, supportive, and
willing to join the adventure.

\chapter{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

\newpage

Diabetes mellitus is a growing global health concern, posing pressing
challenges for public health systems.\textsuperscript{1} As prevalence
rises, more individuals are exposed to an increased risk of premature
mortality and cardiovascular disease (CVD).\textsuperscript{1} At the
same time, people live longer with diabetes, and therefore endure
extended periods under the burden of diabetes-related
complications.\textsuperscript{2} Despite advancements in cardiovascular
care, coronary artery disease and heart failure are still often detected
at more advanced stages, such as during ischemia, major cardiovascular
events, or the onset of symptomatic heart failure in patients with
diabetes.{[}\textsuperscript{3}{]}\textsuperscript{4}

Over the last decades, cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction has
repeatedly gained attention as a risk factor for CVD.\textsuperscript{5}
Heart rate variability (HRV) is considered a reliable marker for
measuring autonomic function, as it reflects the balance between
sympathetic and parasympathetic modulation of heart rate
intervals.\textsuperscript{6} Despite its recognition as a CVD risk
factor, assessment of cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction has not been
implemented in healthcare practice. In diabetes, lower HRV is regarded
as an early indicator of cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN),
which is diagnosed using cardiovascular autonomic reflex tests
(CARTs).\textsuperscript{7} Signs of autonomic dysfunction, may already
be present in individuals with prediabetes.\textsuperscript{8} Despite
rising prevalence and increased CVD risk, people with prediabetes often
remain outside structured treatment pathways
.{[}\textsuperscript{9}{]}\textsuperscript{10} Although diabetes
contributes to autonomic dysfunction, it is still unclear at what stage
in the diabetes risk spectrum HRV and CARTs become clinically useful for
assessing CVD risk.

In the past, measuring HRV needed special instruments like an
electrocardiogram. Today, it's easy to track HRV with everyday devices
like smartwatches.{[}\textsuperscript{11}{]}\textsuperscript{12} This
increased accessibility allows for continuous monitoring and a better
understanding of HRV over extended periods and under various free-living
conditions.\textsuperscript{13} However, long-term HRV patterns and the
relation between specific diurnal responses and risk of cardiovascular
complications remain less well understood.

The overall aim of this dissertation is to understand how cardiovascular
autonomic dysfunction/CAN affects cardiovascular disease risk
(i.e.~heart failure, stroke, myocardial infarction) and specific
subclinical markers of CVD: carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity and
carotid artery distensibility in populations covering the whole glycemic
continuum, from healthy glucose metabolism to type 2 diabetes.

\newpage

This background introduces the concept of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and its
associated cardiovascular risk. It then provides an overview of various
cardiovascular complications, including arteriosclerosis,
atherosclerosis, and heart failure. Finally, it describes cardiovascular
autonomic function (autonomic function) and its potential to enhance our
understanding of CVD.

\hypertarget{type-2-diabetes-and-prediabetes}{%
\section{Type 2 diabetes and
prediabetes}\label{type-2-diabetes-and-prediabetes}}

The progression from normal glucose metabolism to T2D is characterized
by sustained elevations in blood glucose levels. T2D is characterized by
a progressive decline in beta-cell function, most often as a consequence
of chronic insulin
resistance.{[}\textsuperscript{14}{]}\textsuperscript{15} Insulin
resistance occurs when certain tissues, such as muscle and liver
tissues, lose their sensitivity to insulin.\textsuperscript{15} As a
result, glucose is not effectively taken up by these tissues and remains
in the circulation.\textsuperscript{15} Meanwhile, beta-cell function
deteriorates, leading to a diminished insulin response to glucose
levels.\textsuperscript{15} Years before a T2D diagnosis, these changes
contribute to rising fasting and postprandial glucose
levels.\textsuperscript{14}

The body regulates glucose through various mechanism. During fasting,
pancreatic alpha cells secrete glucagon, which stimulates hepatic
glucose production via glycogenolysis and
gluconeogenesis.\textsuperscript{15} After a meal, rising blood glucose
levels stimulate pancreatic beta cells to release insulin and trigger
the secretion of incretins, such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) from
the intestines.\textsuperscript{15} Insulin and incretins work together
to suppress hepatic glucose production, while insulin promotes glucose
uptake in muscle and adipose tissue.\textsuperscript{15} Excess glucose
is primarily stored as glycogen in the liver and muscles, with some
converted to triglycerides for long-term storage. Multiple organs,
including the pancreas, liver, kidneys, intestines, muscle, and adipose
tissue are involved in this coordinated process.\textsuperscript{15} The
autonomic nervous system plays a supportive role in glucose homeostasis
by modulating metabolic activity. Parasympathetic signals tend to reduce
glucose production, while sympathetic signals enhance it, especially
during hypoglycemia.\textsuperscript{15}

The World Health Organization (WHO) and American Diabetes Association
(ADA) diagnostic criteria for T2D include fasting plasma glucose ≥7.0
mmol/L, 2-hour plasma glucose ≥11.1 mmol/L during an oral glucose
tolerance test (OGTT), or hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) ≥6.5\% (48
mmol/mol).{[}\textsuperscript{16}{]}\textsuperscript{17} The OGTT
measures glucose levels two hours after the ingestion of a standard
75-gram glucose load in the fasting state\textsuperscript{17}.
Progression towards diabetes is a continuous process, with type 2
diabetes defined based on glucose thresholds associated with an
increased risk of diabetes-specific microvascular complications,
particularly retinopathy\textsuperscript{18}. Many complications of
diabetes, such as macrovascular disease, neuropathy, cancer, and
cognitive impairment, may start to develop at earlier stages of
dysglycemia{[}\textsuperscript{19}{]}\textsuperscript{20}\textsuperscript{21}.
This stage is referred to as prediabetes or high risk of diabetes and is
defined by fasting plasma glucose levels between 6.1--6.9 mmol/L, 2-hour
plasma glucose levels between 7.8--11.0 mmol/L (WHO criteria), and HbA1c
levels between 5.7--6.4\% (39--47 mmol/mol) (ADA
criteria)\textsuperscript{17}. In parallel with the growing prevalence
of T2D, the prevalence of prediabetes is also on the
rise.\textsuperscript{9}

Risk factors for progression to T2D and its complications range from
genetic predisposition to lifestyle and socio-environmental factors. The
most common risk factor for diabetes is obesity, and in particular
central obesity.\textsuperscript{22} The accumulation of diabetes risk
factors is linked with a combination of adverse changes in
cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, including increases in
low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, and systolic
blood pressure, along with decreases in high-density lipoprotein (HDL)
cholesterol.\textsuperscript{23}

Diabetes increases the risk of both microvascular and macrovascular
complications, which are major contributors to the morbidity and
mortality associated with the disease\textsuperscript{15}. Beyond
conventional CVD risk factors, chronic hyperglycemia promotes the
formation of harmful byproducts such as reactive oxygen species and
advanced glycation end products, which drive oxidative stress and
inflammation\textsuperscript{24}. These processes contribute to
endothelial dysfunction and vascular damage.\textsuperscript{24} While
the general mechanisms underlying macrovascular complications are well
described, the identification of preclinical stages of CVD and the
differentiation of CVD risk between individuals at high risk of diabetes
and those with established T2D require further
clarification.\textsuperscript{10}

\hypertarget{cardiovascular-disease}{%
\section{Cardiovascular disease}\label{cardiovascular-disease}}

Globally, CVD remains the leading cause of death. At the population
level, CVD risk is primarily attributable to modifiable lifestyle
behaviors such as chronic stress, physical inactivity, unhealthy diet,
excessive alcohol consumption, and smoking, as well as
socio-environmental factors like socio-economic status and air
pollution.\textsuperscript{25} At the individual level, these exposures
often manifest through more proximal biological risk factors, including
hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, and
obesity.\textsuperscript{26} Along the causal pathway, these
intermediate conditions tend to cluster, thereby accelerating disease
progression. These processes are underpinned by biomolecular mechanisms,
including local and systemic inflammation, oxidative stress involving
oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and dysregulated immune
responses mediated by pro-inflammatory cytokines and signaling
pathways.\textsuperscript{27} Risk factors contribute to distinct
pathophysiological mechanisms across different types of CVD, involving
structural, signaling, inflammatory, and hemodynamic changes within the
cardiovascular
system.{[}\textsuperscript{28}{]}\textsuperscript{27}\textsuperscript{29}
Among these, cellular and molecular signaling pathways play a central
role in regulating vascular tone, cardiac function, and inflammatory
responses. These processes are closely modulated by the autonomic
nervous system through sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve
branches.{[}\textsuperscript{30}{]}\textsuperscript{31}{[}\textsuperscript{32}{]}\textsuperscript{33}

\hypertarget{arteriosclerosis}{%
\subsection{Arteriosclerosis}\label{arteriosclerosis}}

Evidence emphasizes the role of vascular aging in early disease
development, extending beyond the traditional focus on cardiovascular
endpoints.\textsuperscript{29} Arteriosclerosis, commonly referred to as
arterial stiffness, is a hallmark of this process. Biologically, the
medial layer of large arteries consists of a structured network of
vascular smooth muscle cells together with elastic and collagen fibers,
forming functional musculoelastic sheets.\textsuperscript{34} Arterial
stiffness arises from progressive remodeling of the arterial
wall.{[}\textsuperscript{29}{]}\textsuperscript{35} This remodeling is
driven by changes in the structural interactions between elastin and
collagen fibers, along with functional alterations in vascular smooth
muscle cells and the accumulation of calcium and advanced glycation end
products.\textsuperscript{34} Remodeling of the arterial wall increases
systolic blood pressure and reduces coronary perfusion, thereby
contributing to the development of hypertension and, eventually,
cardiovascular disease.\textsuperscript{36} Additionally, arterial
stiffness elevates the pulsatile load on the microcirculation, promoting
the progression of chronic kidney disease, vascular dementia, and
Alzheimer's disease.\textsuperscript{29}

\hypertarget{atherosclerosis}{%
\subsection{Atherosclerosis}\label{atherosclerosis}}

Atherosclerosis is characterized by the accumulation of cholesterol,
lipids, and other substances within the arterial walls, forming plaques
that narrow the arteries and reduce blood flow often at specific sites
such as the coronary and carotid arteries.\textsuperscript{37} This
chronic process can lead to progressive occlusion of the vessel,
contributing to reduced oxygen supply to the heart (ref.), often leading
to symptoms of angina.

Atherosclerotic plaques can be classified into stable and unstable
types, each with distinct structural characteristics and clinical
implications. Stable plaques typically have a thick fibrous cap composed
of collagen, a small lipid core, and low levels of
inflammation.\textsuperscript{38} These plaques are less likely to
rupture and tend to remain intact over time due to internal remodeling.
In contrast, unstable plaques, also known as vulnerable plaques, often
contain a large lipid-rich necrotic core, a thin fibrous cap, and
infiltration by inflammatory cells such as
macrophages.\textsuperscript{38} A well-recognized subtype of unstable
plaque is the thin-cap fibroatheroma, which is particularly prone to
rupture. When rupture occurs, the necrotic core becomes exposed to the
bloodstream, initiating the formation of a thrombus or blood clot. This
acute event can abruptly obstruct the artery, resulting in myocardial
infarction (MI).\textsuperscript{38} Chronic ischemia due to reduced
coronary perfusion can lead to myocardial remodeling, impaired
contractility, and electrical instability, thereby increasing the risk
of arrhythmias and heart
failure.{[}\textsuperscript{39}{]}\textsuperscript{40}

\textbf{Myocardial infarction}

MI occurs due to the rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque in the
coronary arteries, triggering thrombus formation that blocks blood
flow.\textsuperscript{41} This leads to oxygen deprivation (ischemia)
and subsequent myocardial injury or necrosis.\textsuperscript{41} If
untreated, this process can cause extensive cardiac damage and fatal
arrhythmias.\textsuperscript{41} Over the past decades, the incidence of
MI has declined in high-income countries with a marked reduction in
MI-related mortality.\textsuperscript{42} These improvements are largely
attributed to a combination of public health initiatives and medical
advances. On the public health front, a substantial decrease in smoking
prevalence has been the most important lifestyle-related factor
contributing to the reduction in
CVD.{[}\textsuperscript{43}{]}\textsuperscript{44} Medically, the
improved preventive management of hypertension and hyperlipidemia has
reduced the burden of atherosclerotic disease.\textsuperscript{42} In
acute care, the widespread adoption of evidence-based interventions such
as thrombolytic therapy, percutaneous coronary interventions (including
stenting), and coronary artery bypass grafting has improved survival and
outcomes following MI.\textsuperscript{45} In T2D, the risk of MI is
elevated by 72\%, with an approximately threefold risk among patients
under 60 years compared to age under 60 without T2D.\textsuperscript{46}
Similar to the general population, MI incidence and fatality have
declined among people with
diabetes.{[}\textsuperscript{47}{]}\textsuperscript{\textbf{greggedwardw?}}

\textbf{Stroke}

The majority of strokes are ischemic and result from an obstruction in a
cerebral artery. The process often begins with the development of
atherosclerotic plaques at the carotid artery bifurcation, which can
lead to the formation of emboli\textsuperscript{48}. These emboli then
travel through the bloodstream and eventually lodge in the cerebral
arterial tree, causing ischemic stroke\textsuperscript{48}. The second
main cause is hemorrhagic stroke, which is characterized as a
hypertensive small-vessel disease, leading to small lipohyalinotic
aneurysms that subsequently rupture, causing intracerebral
bleeding.{[}\textsuperscript{49}{]}\textsuperscript{50} Ischemic stroke
remains one of the global leading contributors to mortality and
disability.\textsuperscript{51} The incidence, prevalence, and
cause-specific mortality of stroke remain high but have stagnated,
although some declines have been observed in high-income
countries.\textsuperscript{52} Individuals with elevated glucose levels,
as measured by fasting plasma glucose, OGTT, or HbA1c, have a 26\%
higher risk of stroke compared to those with normal glucose
levels.{[}\textsuperscript{53}{]}\textsuperscript{54} In T2D, the
ischemic stroke risk is elevated almost two-fold compared with
individuals without diabetes.\textsuperscript{46}

\hypertarget{heart-failure}{%
\subsection{Heart failure}\label{heart-failure}}

Heart failure develops gradually with age and often accelerates with the
progression of T2D. As prevention and treatment of CVD have improved
survival in recent years, the prevalence of heart failure has increased,
while the incidence remains stable, but may rise with aging
populations.\textsuperscript{55}

Heart failure may arise as a consequence of atherosclerosis,
arteriosclerosis, or both, contributing to myocardial ischemia, pressure
overload, and structural cardiac changes.\textsuperscript{56} Heart
failure can be defined hemodynamically as the inability to maintain
adequate cardiac output at rest or during exertion, or the ability to do
so only with elevated cardiac filling pressures.\textsuperscript{56} It
is a complex cardiovascular disease caused by structural and functional
changes in the heart musculature, affecting systolic and/or diastolic
pumping function.\textsuperscript{56} Heart failure is generally
classified into two subtypes: heart failure with reduced ejection
fraction (HFrEF) and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction
(HFpEF).\textsuperscript{56} Both subtypes involve cardiac remodeling
but are defined by left ventricular ejection fraction
(LVEF).\textsuperscript{56} HFrEF is defined by an LVEF \textless{}
40\%, while HFpEF is characterized by an LVEF ≥ 50\% along with
structural or functional cardiac abnormalities, as assessed by
echocardiography.\textsuperscript{56} HFrEF is often a consequence of
repeated, non-fatal MIs. These events can leave behind scar tissue in
the myocardium, impairing the heart's ability to contract effectively
and leading to progressive systolic dysfunction.{[}@campbell2024{]}

The most common feature of HFpEF is left ventricular diastolic
dysfunction, caused by impaired relaxation and increased stiffness,
leading to elevated left atrial pressure and reduced diastolic
reserve.\textsuperscript{57} Over the past decades, the prevalence of
HFpEF has increased with an aging population and more people living with
conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, and
obesity.\textsuperscript{58} It is diagnosed based on structural or
functional abnormalities identified through echocardiographic measures,
such as left ventricular hypertrophy, left atrial enlargement, or
elevated filling pressures.\textsuperscript{58} The diagnosis may seem
straightforward, but it is often challenging in community settings, as
patients frequently present without typical heart failure symptoms
(e.g., shortness of breath) and are not routinely assessed with
biomarkers like N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) or
brain-neuretic-peptide (BNP).\textsuperscript{58} As a result, HFpEF is
commonly underdiagnosed and consequently detected at more severe stages,
leading to hospitalization
.{[}\textsuperscript{58}{]}\textsuperscript{58}

\hypertarget{cardiovascular-autonomic-dysfunction}{%
\section{Cardiovascular autonomic
dysfunction}\label{cardiovascular-autonomic-dysfunction}}

The cardiovascular system is regulated by the autonomic nervous system,
which influences heart rate and vasoconstrictuion through the
sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves.\textsuperscript{32} Sympathetic
activation increases heart rate and myocardial contractility by
stimulating the sinoatrial (SA) node, atrioventricular (AV) node, and
ventricular myocardium. In contrast, parasympathetic activation
primarily reduces heart rate by directly modulating SA node activity
through vagal stimulation.\textsuperscript{32} It also slows AV nodal
conduction, predominantly via the left vagus nerve, thereby prolonging
atrioventricular conduction time.\textsuperscript{32} Afferently nerves
mainly carry sensory information (e.g., baroreceptor input from the
carotid sinus and aortic arch) to the brain, which then adjusts efferent
autonomic output to regulate arterial tone. Hence, the autonomic nervous
system dynamically regulates heart rate and blood pressure to maintain
homoeostasis in response to physiological demands, such as rest, stress,
eating and physical activity.\textsuperscript{32}

\end{minipage}%

\end{figure}

In youth, the autonomic nervous system is highly adaptive and responsive
to living conditions, maintaining autonomic balance. However, with
aging, there is a gradual decline in parasympathetic function and an
increase in sympathetic activity. Additionally, metabolism-related
conditions such as obesity and diabetes have been shown to further
contribute to cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction (autonomic
dysfunction).\textsuperscript{59} Autonomic dysfunction reflects a
stressed cardiometabolic environment, as both dysfunction in lipid and
glucose metabolism are associated with increased sympathetic
activity.\textsuperscript{59} This dysfunction may result from
cumulative neural damage mediated by mechanisms such as
hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, and elevated levels of adipokines.
At the same time, autonomic dysfunction is known to disrupt lipid and
glucose metabolism.\textsuperscript{59} Therefore, the relationship
between autonomic dysfunction and cardiometabolic factors is likely a
vicious cycle.\textsuperscript{60} The consequences can lead to
autonomic dysfunction/neuropathy (CAN), resulting in dysregulation in
heart rate and vascular dynamics. CAN prevalent in 12-73\% in
indiviudals with T2D is liked to CVD diabetic kidney disease, and
all-cause
mortality.{[}\textsuperscript{7}{]}\textsuperscript{61}\textsuperscript{62}
In this dissertation, `autonomic dysfunction' will be used as the
broader term, while `CAN' will refer specifically to autonomic
dysfunction resulting from neuropathy in diabetes.

Autonomic function can be assessed using heart rate variability (HRV)
indices, which measure the variation in successive normal RR intervals
in milliseconds. HRV provides time- and frequency-domain estimates of
the balance between sympathetic and parasympathetic
activity.\textsuperscript{6} High HRV reflects an autonomic nervous
system with strong adaptability to the body's demands, whereas low
variation indicates poor adaptation to changing conditions. HRV changes
in response to different physiological or environmental conditions
(e.g., sleep, stress, posture, physical activity), and these changes can
be observed in its natural 24-hour (circadian)
pattern.\textsuperscript{13} Most studies have examined autonomic
function using short-term ECG recordings at rest.\textsuperscript{5}
However, extended HRV recordings across the circadian cycle may offer
deeper insights into the influence of lower-frequency variability
sources, such as very-low frequency (0.003--0.04 Hz) and ultra-low
frequency (≤0.003 Hz){[}reflecting what{]}. HRV has been applied across
several research domains. For example, in psychology as a marker of
mental stress, in exercise physiology as an indicator of recovery, in
cardiovascular research as a marker of autonomic dysfunction due to
cardiac complications, and in diabetes research as a marker of autonomic
neuropathy(ref.,ref.ref.,ref.). T2D alters the expression of sympathetic
bursts, as measured by resting muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA).
MSNA is elevated in individuals with both T2D and hypertension, compared
to those who are normotensive, regardless of whether they have diabetes
or not.\textsuperscript{63} Parasympathetic activity is also impaired in
individuals with high cardiometabolic risk and T2D, as reflected by
reduced baroreflex sensitivity and lower HF and RMSSD short-term
HRV.\textsuperscript{64} Before onset of diabetes and during progression
of diabetes long-term (24-hour) HRV has shown to be lower compare to
those with normal glucose
metabolism.{[}\textsuperscript{60}{]}\textsuperscript{8} Cardiovascular
autonomic reflex tests (CARTs) and orthostatic hypotension are
considered the gold standard for assessing CAN.\textsuperscript{65} The
diagnosis includes assessing pulse rate ratio under test conditions,
such as the deep breathing test, the lying-to-standing test, and the
Valsalva maneuver.\textsuperscript{65} Both HRV and CARTs have shown to
be associated with cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and all-cause
mortality, primarily in populations with T2D or established
cardiovascular
disease.{[}\textsuperscript{5}{]}\textsuperscript{61}\textsuperscript{66}
However, it remains unclear at which stage in the progression of
diabetes risk to pre-diabetes to diabetes these measures begin to
influence the risk of cardiovascular complications.

\hypertarget{risk-stratification}{%
\section{Risk-stratification}\label{risk-stratification}}

Current cardiopreventive guidelines place strong emphasis on prevention
and treatment of T2D. The 2022 ADA/EASD guidelines for the management of
hyperglycemia in T2D recommend, cardioprotective medication
(glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists {[}GLP-1RA{]} and
Sodium-Glucose Transport Protein 2 {[}SGLT2{]} inhibitors) as first-line
options for individuals at high cardiovascular risk. Due to their
benefits in heart failure, SGLT2 inhibitors are specifically recommended
for patients with documented HFrEF or HFpEF. High cardiovascular risk is
defined as the presence of at least two risk factors at age
\textgreater55 years, such as obesity, hypertension, smoking,
dyslipidemia, or albuminuria. However, no additional preclinical markers
are recommended to identify individuals at higher CVD or HF risk or for
younger individuals. Despite their increased risk of cardiovascular
complications, individuals at high risk of developing diabetes remain
outside structured treatment options, even though diabetes risk and
cardiometabolic markers can be successfully modified through lifestyle
interventions and medication such as GLP-1 analogoues
{[}\textsuperscript{67}{]}\textsuperscript{68}. During the progression
and following the onset of T2D, preclinical indicators of CVD risk
become apparent, highlighting the potential for early risk
stratification. Risk stratification is the process of classifying or
ranking individuals in increasing order of estimated risk, based on risk
scores, biomarker levels, omic data (metabolomic, proteomics, and
genomic) or preclinical conditions. This approach aids in identifying
patients at highest risk for further prognostic or diagnostic purposes,
identifying subgroups that require further evaluation, intensified
treatment, or lifestyle modifications.

Autonomic dysfunction despite its relationship with cardiovascular
complication has not been used in clinical practice. Larger
epidemiological cohort studies encompassing various stages of diabetes
risk, from normal glucose metabolism to prediabetes, onset of T2D, and
longer term progression of T2D, serve as valuable resources for
identifying risk-stratification opportunities. . Epidemiological studies
provide a broad representation of the target population, allowing an
understanding of the relationship between autonomic dysfunction and
cardiovascular complications. Epidemiological studies also have the
potential to determine when, along the trajectory of diabetes
progression and duration, autonomic function is meaningful for
cardiovascular risk-stratification.

\hypertarget{aim-and-hypothesis}{%
\chapter{Aim and hypothesis}\label{aim-and-hypothesis}}

\newpage

The overarching hypothesis of this dissertation are that:

• CAN and autonomic dysfunction are associated with CVD and act as an
early risk factor for heart failure and other cardiovascular
complications, including stroke, and myocardial infarction in patients
with prediabetes and/or T2D.

• Autonomic dysfunction is associated with higher levels of sub-clinical
meassures of CVD such as carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity and carotid
artery distensibility.

This dissertation investigates the hypothesis by addressing the
following three aims:

Study I: Quantify the cross-sectional association between 24-hour HRV
and subclinical markers of cardiovascular complications: carotid-femoral
pulse wave velocity and carotid artery distensibility, in participants
with normal glucose metabolism, prediabetes or T2D.

Study II: Quantify the longitudinal association of multiday and hourly
HRV with incidence of ischemic-related CVD, heart failure, and all-cause
mortality in a population with high-risk of diabetes.

Study III: Quantify the cross-sectional association between CAN and
heart failure. Heart failure will be defined by clinical measures
i.e.~N-terminal-pro-BNP (NT-proBNP), WATCH-DM risk, and New York Heart
Association (NYHA) classification scores among individuals with T2D.

Study}\label{study-i---the-maastricht-study}}

The Maastricht Study is a prospective observational population-based
study of the general population of the province of Limburg, in the
southern part of the Netherlands. The study emphasized the recruitment
of people with T2D, through the regional Diabetes Patient Registry, to
extensively phenotype individuals with T2D and those in intermediate
stages of the disease. The eligibility criteria included an age range of
40--70 years. Participants were recruited through mass media campaigns
and mailings from municipal registries (Gemeentelijke Basis
Administratie; GBA). In the analysis of Study I, the study among 7449
people included participants with measurements of 24-hour HRV and at
least one measure of arterial stiffness (carotid-femoral pulse wave
velocity or carotid artery distensibility), both of which were completed
within a three-month period between November 2010 and December 2020. The
study has been approved by the institutional medical ethics committee
(NL31329.068.10) and the Minister of Health, Welfare and Sports of the
Netherlands (Permit 131088-105234-PG). All participants gave written

\hypertarget{study-ii---addition-pro}{%
\subsubsection{Study II - ADDITION-PRO}\label{study-ii---addition-pro}}

The ADDITION-PRO study is a prospective, population-based cohort nested
within the Danish arm of the ADDITION-Europe study. ADDITION was
originally designed as a stepwise screening program for T2D in general
practice, aiming to identify individuals with screen-detected T2D for
recruitment into the ADDITION trial. ADDITION-PRO aims to investigate
early markers of CVD and metabolic dysfunction in individuals in
different tiers of diabetes risk.

The ADDITION-Europe screening program identified a large number of
individuals with impaired fasting glucose (IFG), impaired glucose
tolerance (IGT), and normoglycemia despite having risk factors for
diabetes and CVD. Participants for ADDITION-PRO were recruited from the
original ADDITION-DK screening cohort, which included individuals from
190 general practices across Denmark. The recruitment strategy focused
on individuals at high risk of diabetes without T2D, identified through
a stepwise screening program that incorporated the Danish diabetes risk
score from the Inter99 study\textsuperscript{70}. This assessment,
conducted between 2001 and 2006, considered factors such as age, sex,
history of gestational diabetes, family history of diabetes, known
hypertension, BMI, and physical activity. High-risk individuals were
further screened for T2D using blood measurements, including HbA1c,
random blood glucose, FPG, and OGTT. Those with screen-detected
diabetes, confirmed by a second OGTT, were invited to participate in the
ADDITION trial. High risk individuals without T2D were further
considered in as the sampling frame for ADDITION-PRO.

Between 2009 and 2011, a follow-up health examination was conducted at
four ADDITION-DK study centers to establish a cohort baseline. Eligible
participants were those still alive, residing near the research centers
(Steno Diabetes Center Copenhagen, Aarhus University Hospital, Holstebro
Hospital, and the Hospital of South West Jutland, Esbjerg), and who had
not withdrawn consent. Eligibility criteria included individuals aged
40--70 years who had previously undergone diabetes screening in
ADDITION-DK. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy, psychological or
psychiatric disorders preventing informed consent, and life-limiting
conditions. One key feature of the data collection was the precise
measurement of physical activity and energy expenditure using a combined
chest worn accelerometer/heart rate monitor (ActiHeart), which recorded
acceleration and heart rate over a week. In study II, participants with
at least a 48-hour recording was included for the primary analysis, and
then participants with hourly measures of physical acceleration during
the hourly HRV recording was included in the second analysis.
Participant with prior CVD ten years before inclusion was also excluded.

Disease history and follow-up data for the population were obtained from
Denmark's national registry system, which allows linkage of health
records using the personal Civil Registration Number assigned to all
citizens. The following national registries were accessed to collect
information on incident CVD and mortality, medication use, and
healthcare utilization: the National Patient Registry (hospital
admissions and outpatient contacts), the National Health Service
Registry (general practice visits), the Medical Prescription Registry,
the Diabetes Registry, and the Cause of Death Registry.

\subsubsection{Study III - CANCAN}\label{study-iii---cancan}}

The CANCAN Study is an observational study conducted at two hospital
outpatient clinics in Viborg Regional Hospital and Regional Hospital
Gødstrup. It aims to implement a screening protocol for identifying
high-risk individuals using CAN assessments, continuous glucose
monitoring, and heart failure indicators. All measures were part of
routine clinical care for T2D in Central Denmark. We included 200 adults
(\textgreater18 years) with T2D with a duration of over one year.
Exclusion criteria were recent laser-treated eye disease (≤3 months),
pregnancy, lactation, life-threatening illness, or cognitive impairment
preventing consent. Participants were identified via electronic records
and informed about the study by their doctor during a telephone call.
Those interested attended a dedicated meeting before their annual
diabetes exam, where study details were discussed. Recruitment took
place from 2021 to 2024. In study III, participants without a valid
NT-proBNP measurement were excluded.

In study I-III different devices were used to capture the distance
between each heartbeat defined as RR intervals from electrocardiogram
traces either directly from heart-beat traces or indirectly from pulse
traces. From this a sequence of successive heart beat intervals is
extracted to calculate time- and frequency domain HRV.

\emph{Time-domain indices}

Time-domain measures of HRV are based on the statistical distribution of
normal-to-normal (NN) heartbeat intervals. Description of time-domain
indices are summarized in \textbf{?@tbl-td}.

\emph{Frequency-domain indices}

Frequency-domain HRV indices are derived from sequences of NN intervals
transformed into the spectral domain using Fourier transformation. These
indices quantify heart rate oscillations over different timescales.
Short-term variations, such as respiratory sinus arrhythmia, reflect
rapid autonomic changes, while longer oscillations capture autonomic
responses to posture changes, circadian rhythms, or other physiological
processes. Description of frequency-domain indices are summarized in
\textbf{?@tbl-fq}.

\end{longtable}

\end{minipage}%

\end{table}

\textbf{Holter recordings in study I}

All ECG recordings were obtained using a 12-lead Holter system
(Fysiologic ECG Services, Amsterdam, the Netherlands) over 24 hours, as
previously described. Participants were instructed to follow their
regular daily activities but avoid showering during the recording. The
ECG data were processed using proprietary Holter Analysis Software
(Fysiologic ECG Services), where artefacts and ectopic beats were
excluded through automated processing and manual validation. A minimum
recording duration of 18 hours was required for further analysis.
Inter-beat intervals between consecutive sinus beats were provided in
milliseconds (ms). Time-domain HRV indices were calculated, including
SDNN, SDANN, RMSSD, SDNN index, and pNN50. Frequency-domain measures
were derived using Fast Fourier Transform, including TP, ULF, VLF, LF,
and HF. Outliers were removed. HRV indices were standardised by their
mean and SD, and composite Z-scores were computed for time and
frequency-domain measures, respectively. This selection of indices
covers the main sources of HRV variance.

\textbf{ActiHeart heart rate and physical activity in study II}

Heart rate was measured using a combined accelerometer and heart rate
monitor (ActiHeart, CamNTech, Cambridge, UK), recording uniaxial
acceleration and heart rate. The data collection and processing methods
have been described previously. Mean heart rates were recorded in
30-second epochs, and HRV was derived as the variation between
consecutive normal heartbeats on the ECG. HRV calculations were
performed using the RHRV package (version 4.2.7) in R, including SDNN,
SDANN, SDNN index, TINN, and mean HR (mHR). We tested our approach on a
dataset with full access to all interbeat intervals to validate our
algorithm\textsuperscript{78}. These indices have shown high validity
for HRV indices based on global distribution (e.g.~SDNN, SDANN, SDNNi)
in 24-hour recordings. HRV indices were calculated by week, 24-hour
cycle, and hour of the day, with hourly values averaged across recording
days.

\textbf{Vagus device for cardiovascular autonomic reflex test in study
III}

CAN was diagnosed using cardiovascular autonomic reflex tests (CARTs),
the gold standard for CAN assessment. R-R intervals were derived from an
ECG signal using the Vagus™ device (Medicus Engineering, Aarhus,
Denmark)\textsuperscript{65}. We used pulse rate ratios measured under
different conditions. Three standardized cardiovascular autonomic reflex
tests (CARTs) were performed: (1) lying-to-standing, (2) deep breathing,
and the (3) Valsalva manoeuvre, following a standardized protocol
conducted between 8:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m., after 10 minutes of supine
rest. Smoking and caffeine intake were prohibited two hours before
testing. Each test was conducted once by trained examiners.

Manifest CAN was defined as two or more abnormal CARTs using
age-specific cut-off values (ref.). The Vagus™ device's accuracy has
been validated against FDA standards and stationary devices, showing
moderate to high reproducibility (ref.). Orthostatic hypertension was
defined as a sustained drop in systolic blood pressure of ≥20 mmHg or
diastolic blood pressure of ≥10 mmHg within three minutes of standing
(ref.).

\hypertarget{confounders-and-variables-for-instrumental-bias}{%
\subsection{Confounders and variables for instrumental
bias}\label{confounders-and-variables-for-instrumental-bias}}

Across Studies I, II, and III, a comprehensive set of covariates and
potential confounders were assessed, including lifestyle factors,
clinical measurements, biochemical markers, and socioeconomic
indicators.

Smoking status was self-reported in all studies, categorized as never,
former, or current (Study I), current/ex/never (Study II), and
smoker/non-smoker (Study III). Alcohol consumption was recorded as
average weekly units in all three studies. Physical activity was
assessed via self-report in Studies I, II, III, with Study I capturing
total and moderate-to-vigorous activity (hours/week), Study II used the
Recent Physical Activity Questionnaire (RPAQ) to calculate physical
activity energy expenditure (PAEE), and Study III classifying activity
as sedentary or non-sedentary. In Study II also used combined
accelerometry and heart rate monitoring (ActiHeart) to estimate PAEE.
Study II included register-based data on socioeconomic status at
baseline, including education length, income, and employment status. All
studies included measurements of body mass index (BMI), waist
circumference, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure, obtained
during clinical examinations.

Blood samples were analyzed in all studies for HbA1c, fasting plasma
glucose (FPG), triglycerides, total cholesterol, high-density
lipoprotein (HDL), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Study
I also included a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) to classify
glucose metabolism status based on FPG and OGTT (normal, prediabetes,
T2D) using WHO 2006 criteria, excluding HbA1c as a diagnostic criterion.
Study III additionally measured creatinine, estimated glomerular
filtration rate (eGFR), and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio.

Self-reported history of CVD and use of anti-hypertensive,
glucose-lowering, and lipid-lowering medications were collected in all
studies. In Study II, history of CVD events in the 10 years prior to
baseline were retrieved from national registers. In Study III, history
of CVD was collected electronic patient records.

\hypertarget{arterial-stiffness}{%
\subsection{Arterial stiffness}\label{arterial-stiffness}}

Arterial stiffness is characterized by arteriosclerosis and
atherosclerosis properties of the arteries. The stiffness of different
segments of the vascular musculature can be assessed both locally and
dynamically. Aortic and carotid stiffness were assessed as markers of
arterial stiffness, following previously described
procedures\textsuperscript{79}.

\textbf{Pulse wave velocity}

Aortic stiffness was measured by carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity
(cf-PWV) using applanation tonometry (SphygmoCor, Atcor Medical, Sydney,
Australia), with the median of at least three consecutive recordings
included in the analysis. cf-PWV is calculated based on the time between
the ECG systole and the arrival of the pressure wave at the femoral and
carotid measurement sites along with the distance between these two
measurement sites. cf-PWV is measured with participants in a supine
position following a 10-minute rest period. The aortic path length was
determined using a tape measure by subtracting the carotid-to-sternal
notch distance from the femoral-to-sternal notch
distance\textsuperscript{79}.

\textbf{Carotid artery distensibility}

Carotid stiffness was assessed by the carotid artery distensibility
coefficient (CD), based on ultrasound imaging of the left common carotid
artery using a 7.5 MHz linear probe (MyLab 70, Esaote Europe,
Maastricht, the Netherlands). CD was calculated as ΔD/braPP, where ΔD
represents carotid distension and braPP is brachial pulse pressure. Mean
heart rate and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were recorded every five
minutes using an oscillometer device (Accutorr Plus, Datascope,
Montvale, NJ, USA)\textsuperscript{79}..

\hypertarget{indicators-of-heart-failure}{%
\subsection{Indicators of heart
failure}\label{indicators-of-heart-failure}}

N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) is a
neuretic peptide that can be used to detect patients with heart failure
and the progression of heart failure. It derives from B-type natriuretic
peptid (BNP) which is a cardial neurohormone, that is synthesized and
secreted as response to stretched cariomycytes and cardiac volume
overload. After secretion, proBNP is cleaved, releasing the active
hormone BNP along with the remaining N-terminal fragment, known as
NT-proBNP. In Study III, a blood sample was taken at the study cite.
Description of the NT-proBNP analysis of plasma samples is described in
supplementary material {[}ref.{]}.

A modified version of the validated The WATCH-DM heart failure risk
score was used. The risk score is based on 9 variables: two binary
(history of myocardial infarction and coronary artery bypass grafting)
and seven continuous (age, BMI, systolic/diastolic BP, serum creatinine,
HDL cholesterol, and HbA1c). Scores range from 0--39, categorized as
very low (≤11), low (12--13), moderate (14--15), high (16--18), and very
high (≥19) risk.

NYHA class stage I-IV was included. Heart failure symptoms were defined
as NYHA class II--IV, assessed by a physician.

\hypertarget{cardiovascular-events}{%
\subsection{Cardiovascular events}\label{cardiovascular-events}}

Information on CVD events and mortality was obtained from the Danish
National Patient Registers until 2021 by utilizing the ICD-10 codes for
stroke, myocardial infarction, cardiovascular death, cardiovascular
revascularization, and heart failure. We defined three-point major
adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) as myocardial infarction, stroke,
cardiovascular revascularization, and cardiovascular death.

\hypertarget{cross-sectional-analysis}{%
\subsection{Cross-sectional analysis}\label{cross-sectional-analysis}}

\emph{Study I}

In Study I, we used multiple linear regression to investigate
associations between multiday HRV and arterial stiffness. Model 1
adjusted for age, sex, education, glucose metabolism status, and mean
arterial pressure (MAP) to account for the oversampling of individuals
with T2D and potential instrumental bias of arterial pressure flow.
Model 2 included additional adjustments for smoking behavior, alcohol
consumption, physical activity, body mass index, HbA1c, triglycerides,
total-to-HDL cholesterol ratio, and medication use. Arterial stiffness
measures were log-transformed to ensure normally distributed residuals
and back-transformed into percentage change estimates. A sex interaction
term was added to assess if the association differed between sex. We
performed sensitivity analyses excluding individuals on antihypertensive
treatment or glucose-lowering medication. We performed sensitivity
analyses excluding individuals on antihypertensive treatment or
glucose-lowering medication.

\emph{Study III}

In Study III, we applied logistic regression models to investigate the
association between CAN and heart failure, using NT-proBNP as the
primary outcome. We adjusted for age, sex, and diabetes duration,
smoking behavior, alcohol consumption, body mass index, HbA1c,
triglycerides, total cholesterol, and antihypertensive medication, eGFR
and prior CVD. We performed sensitivity analyses and excluded
participants with beta-blocker treatment or prior CVD. We applied
logistic regression to assess the odds of CAN asoociation wtih heart
failure symptoms, defined by a NYHA class II or higher, adjusting for
covaties in primary analysis. Linear regression was employed to evaluate
differences in the WATCH-DM risk score between individuals with and
without CAN.

\hypertarget{time-to-event-analysis}{%
\subsection{Time-to-event analysis}\label{time-to-event-analysis}}

In Study II, we used Poisson regression models to quantify the
associations between HRV and cardiovascular events, as follow-up data
were undisturbed over time and to avoid assumptions of proportional
hazards\textsuperscript{80}. Multiday HRV was modelled using splines
with knots at predefined percentiles to assess non-linear associations.
Hourly HRV was analysed separately for each hour to observe if the
association of HRV had diurnal variation. Both HRV and mHR were
standardized by their mean and standard deviation to ensure
comparability. Based on assumptions about potential confounding pathways
summarized in directed acyclic graphs (DAG), we fitted two models: Model
1 adjusted for age and sex, while Model 2 further adjusted for
education, smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity (physical
activity energy expenditure (PAEE) calculated from Recent Physical
Activity Questionnaire RPAQ), body mass index, total cholesterol, and
HbA1c. Additional analyses were performed with HRV pre-adjusted for
concurrent heart rate and physical acceleration to account the influence
of these factors. Missing covariates were handled using multiple
imputation. Each individual's follow-up period began at the time of
their inclusion in the baseline examination. To calculate age-specific
incidence rate (IR) we did the following. Follow-up ended at the
earliest occurrence of CVD, heart failure, all-cause mortality, death,
or the end of the study period . The follow-up time was divided into
one-year intervals based on the individual's age. Using this age-split
data, incidence rates of CVD, heart failure, and all-cause mortality
were analyzed in relation to the HRV, with age treated as a time-varying
covariate in a Poisson regression model.

\hypertarget{effect-modification}{%
\subsection{Effect modification}\label{effect-modification}}

Effect modification is used to assess whether the association between an
exposure and an outcome varies depending on the level of a third
variable, known as the effect modifier\textsuperscript{81}.

In Study I, it was hypothesized that the association between 24-hour and
arterial stiffness was stronger in strata of progression of diabetes
(normal glucose metabolism, prediabetes, T2D). Therefore, interaction
term between HRV and diabetes status was included to observe the size of
the association across strata. We did subsidiary analysis in a
subpopulation without T2D to check if the effect was modified by HbA1c.
In Study II, the association between multiday HRV and CVD endpoints
varied by sex was quantified, to explore potential biological
dimorphism. In Study III, we aimed to determine whether the association
between CAN and elevated NT-proBNP is present in the subgroup without
symptoms, defined as NYHA class \textless{} II. Hence, the hypothesis
was no significant effect modification between groups with and without
symptoms. Similarly, whether the association remains present in the
group classified as low to moderate risk of heart failure was explored,
based on the WATCH-DM risk score.

A significant effect modification between the exposure and the effect
modifier in all analyses was defined as an interaction term with a
p-value \textless{} 0.05.

\hypertarget{multiple-imputed-by-chained-equations}{%
\subsection{Multiple imputed by chained
equations}\label{multiple-imputed-by-chained-equations}}

Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE) is a method for handling
missing data in datasets. This procedure imputes missing values through
an iterative series of predictive models, generating plausible estimates
while preserving the relationships within the data. To avoid one
imputation for missing value could give the value the same confidence as
the a non-missing value, Rubins Rule was followed. Rubin's rules in MICE
combine results from multiple imputed datasets by pooling estimates of
interest (e.g., means or regression coefficients) using their within-
and between-imputation variances. Thus, we ensure valid statistical
inferences by accounting for the uncertainty introduced by missing data.

In Study II, confounders was imputed to include as many participants and
avoid excluding population with our without cardiovascular or mortality
events. Dataset was imputed 10 times. In Study III, missing CART was
imputed, as a proportion of participants had non-valid test due to
insufficient air in the valsalva manuevre, unstable heart beats or data
error. These variables was used as auxiliary variables in imputation to
reduce bias\textsuperscript{82}. All available variables of biochemical
measures, diagnosis, medication and cause of non-valid CART was used to
impute each missing CART using predictive mean matching.

\hypertarget{instrumental-bias}{%
\subsection{Instrumental bias}\label{instrumental-bias}}

In Study I-III we are investigating the body properties by dynamic
measures and biomarkers to quantify autonomic function, arterial
stiffness, and cardiac function. Other conditions may affect the
properties we are attempting to measure, and thus are causing
instrumental bias.

\emph{Vascular Stiffness}

In Study I, we used measurements of arterial stiffness using cf-PWV and
carotid distensibilty. Both measures are influenced by arterial pressure
at the time of examination. Arterial pressure affects the propagation of
the pressure wave through the aorta (cf-PWV) and the expansion and
contraction of the carotid artery (carotid distensibilty) {[}ref.{]}. To
account for this, we adjusted for mean arterial pressure in our models.

\emph{Cardiovascular autonomic function}

In Study II, we assessed autonomic function using multiday HRV
recordings and hourly HRV measurements. Studies have highlighted that
HRV is dependent on heart rate, and low HRV may simply reflect a higher
resting heart rate (rHR). To adjust for this without overcorrecting for
a collinear variable, we pre-adjusted HRV by regressing rHR on HRV,
extracting the residuals, and using these as the pre-adjusted
determinant. For hourly HRV, variability in heart rate may be influenced
by changes in physical activity, creating a risk that HRV serves as a
proxy for movement rather than autonomic function. To address this, we
applied a similar pre-adjustment approach by regressing concurrent heart
rate and physical acceleration to account for physical activity.

\emph{Biomarker of Heart Failure}

In Study III, kidney function and overweight are know to influence
NT-proBNP levels independently of heart failure\textsuperscript{56}. We
adjusted the model to account for the blurred effect of eGFR on
NT-proBNP levels in the analysis.

while CD was 3.3\% (CI: 1.5; 5.1) higher per SD higher in HRV
time-domain Z-score (see see \textbf{?@fig-MS-HRV\_overall} A and B).
Among the time-domain indices, SDNN, SDNNi, and SDANN showed the
strongest associations, with cf-PWV being lower by 2.5\% (CI: 2.0; 3.1),
2.5\% (CI: 1.9; 3.4), and 2.2\% (CI: 1.7; 2.7),

(-1.1\% {[}CI: -1.4; -0.4{]}, and -1.1 {[}-1.7; -0.6{]}), while no
evidence for an association was found with CD\textsuperscript{69}.

\subsection{Effect modification of diabetes
status}\label{effect-modification-of-diabetes-status}}

The study population represented diabetes risk of normal glucose
metabolism (65\%), prediabetes (15\%), and T2D (20\%). The median (IQR)
cf-PWV (aortic stiffness) became higher with diabetes status: NGM: 8.08
m/s (7.28, 9.16), prediabetes: 8.96 m/s (7.84, 10.32), and T2D: 9.36 m/s
(8.16, 10.80). CD (carotid stiffness) decreased: NGM: 15.0 (11.8, 18.8),
prediabetes: 13.5 (10.4, 16.9), and T2D: 12.5 (9.9, 16.0) × 10⁻³/kPa.
SDNN (ms) was highest in NGM and lowered with worsening glucose
metabolism: NGM: 138ms (117, 164), prediabetes: 127ms (106, 152), and
T2D: 116ms (96, 139). Further description of charaterisitcs by diabetes
are described in Table~\ref{tbl-ms}.

The association between HRV time-domain Z-scores and cf-PWV and CD was
significantly modified by prediabetes (cf-PWV: -4.9 {[}CI: -6.523;
-3.243{]} \(^{interaction(*) ^{p-value< 0.01}}\) CD: 8.0 {[}CI:3.8;
12.5{]}\(^{*^{p-value< 0.01}}\)) but not by T2D (cf-PWV: -3.5 \% {[}CI:
-4.8; -2.1){]} \(^{*^{p-value< 0.1}}\) CD: 4.8 \% {[}CI:1.3;
8.4{]}\(^{*^{p-value< 0.1}}\))\textsuperscript{69}. For the indices SDNN
and SDANN, the association with both cf-PWV and CD was significantly
modified by both prediabetes and T2D\textsuperscript{69}.

The association between HRV frequency-domain Z-score and cf-PWV was
significantly modified from normal glucose metabolism by prediabetes
(-5.7 \%{[}CI:-7.4; -3.9{]}\(^{*^{p-value< 0.01}}\)) and T2D (-3.9
\%{[}CI:-5.4; -2.3{]}\(^{*^{p-value< 0.05}}\)) while CD was only
modified by prediabetes (8.3 \%{[}CI:3.6;
13.2{]}\(^{*^{p-value< 0.01}}\)) but not by T2D (5.3 \%{[}CI:1.4;
9.4{]}\(^{*^{p-value< 0.1}}\))\textsuperscript{69}. For the indices
total power and ULF, the association with both cf-PWV and CD was
significantly modified by both prediabetes and T2D. Mean inter beat
interval association with cf-PWV or CD was not significantly modified by
diabetes status\textsuperscript{69}.

As no stepwise increase was observed in the modification of glucose
metabolism status from prediabetes to T2D, subgroup with T2D was
excluded to test whether the association was gradually modified by
dysglycemia. In this subgroup, the association between HRV time and
frequency domain Z-scores and measures of arterial stiffness was
modified by HbA1c (range of interaction p-values: 0.1 to 0.005) (see
Figure Figure~\ref{fig-MS-HRV}). For example, per SD lower HRV frequency
domain Z-score at HbA1c 6.4\% was associated with a 5.4\% higher (CI:
3.5; 7.2) cf-PWV, which was 2.0\% to 4.0\% higher compared to the
magnitude of association at HbA1c levels of 5.6\% and 4.8\% (see see
Figure~\ref{fig-MS-HRV} B). In CD, per SD lower HRV frequency domain
Z-score at HbA1c 6.4\% was associated with an 8.1\% lower (CI: -13.5;
-2.9) CD, which was 4.8\% to 9.5\% lower compared to the magnitude of
association at HbA1c levels of 5.6\% and 4.8\% (see
Figure~\ref{fig-MS-HRV} D). No association between HRV frequency domain
Z-score and CD was observed at HbA1c levels between 4.8\% and 5.2\%.

The ADDITION-PRO population consisted of 1,627 participant with a least
48-hour HRV measures, while 1,432 had all hour represented with hourly
HRV and physical acceleration. The study population included different
tiers of diabetes risk: 154 individuals at low risk (9\%), 889 at high
risk (51\%), 314 with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) (18\%), 226 with
impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) (13\%), and 161 with both IFG and IGT
(9\%). SDNN was splitted into categories by very-low (SDNN\textless{}
100 ms), low (SDNN 100-120 ms), middle (SDNN 121-140 ms), high (SDNN
141-160 ms) and very-high (SDNN \textgreater160 ms).

Charteristics are desribed in Table~\ref{tbl-add}. Participants in the
lowest SDNN group (\textless100 ms) were older (67.4 ± 6.9 years), had
higher BMI (28.1 ± 5.4), HbA1c (5.9 ± 0.9), triglycerides (1.5 ± 0.9
mmol/L), and resting heart rate (67.8 ± 5.7 bpm), were more likely to
use anti-hypertensive medication (61\%), and had lower physical activity
energy expenditure (46.8 ± 24.0 kJ/day) compared to those with higher
SDNN levels.

The mean multiday SDNN was 139.0 (32.3) ms, and the mean heart rate was
73.5 (9.1) bpm\textsuperscript{83}. In the fully adjusted model, SDNN
per SD was associated with a lower incidence rate ratio (IRR) for MACE
0.82 (CI: 0.69; 0.97), heart failure 0.76 (CI: 0.58; 0.99), and
mortality rate ratio of 0.79 (CI: 0.66; 0.94)\textsuperscript{83}. In
model with pre-adjustment for resting heart rate, the proportion of the
association explained between HRV and MACE, HF, and all-cause mortality
was 14\%, 25\%, and 19\%, respectively\textsuperscript{83}. When knots
were included in the model, the risk higher as SDNN dropped below
approximately 120--110 ms (around the 20th percentile), suggesting a
potential threshold for elevated risk\textsuperscript{83}. Therefore,
incidence rate (IR) was calculated at SDNN levels of 100 ms, 120 ms, and
160 ms, respectively, and plotted these as a function of age.

= 120 ms (IR: 37.6 {[}CI: 29.2; 48.3{]}) and SDNN = 160 ms (IR: 34.7
{[}CI: 27.0; 44.5{]}) (Figure~\ref{fig-addprohrv} A). The IR became
higher with age, reaching its peak at age 72. For heart failure at age
65, the IR was 20.5 (CI: 15.3; 27.5) at SDNN = 100 ms, slightly higher
than at SDNN = 120 ms (IR: 19.6 {[}CI: 14.8; 25.9{]}) and SDNN = 160 ms
(IR: 19.8 {[}CI: 15.0; 26.2{]}) (Figure~\ref{fig-addprohrv} B). The IR
remained stable until age 70, after which it became higher. For
all-cause mortality at age 65, the IR was 11.6 (CI: 6.3; 21.4) at SDNN =
100 ms, higher than at SDNN = 120 ms (IR: 7.6 {[}CI: 4.3; 13.3{]}) and
SDNN = 160 ms (IR: 6.0 {[}CI: 3.4; 10.4{]}) (Figure~\ref{fig-addprohrv}

mortality.}\label{hourly-hrv-and-mace-heart-failure-and-all-cause-mortality.}}

From the hourly recordings, I observed a clear periodicity in SDNN,
heart rate, sleep patterns, and physical acceleration. Mean (SD) SDNN
increased from 5--6 AM (70.2 {[}28.8{]} ms), peaking at 8--9 AM (92.1
{[}29.0{]} ms), followed by a gradual decline, reaching its lowest point
around 2 AM the next day (64.1 {[}28.1{]} ms)\textsuperscript{83}. A
similar circadian pattern was observed in heart rate, although its peak
occurred two hours later, starting at 9 AM (76.7 {[}10.9{]}
bpm)\textsuperscript{83}. After peaking, heart rate remained stable
throughout the afternoon before gradually
decreasing\textsuperscript{83}.

In Figure~\ref{fig-ADD_PRO_risk_by_hour}, I observe hourly SDNN
(preadjusted for heart rate and physical acceleration), heart rate, and
physical acceleration association. Models was adjusted for age, sex,
education, alcohol consumption, smoking behavior, BMI, total
cholesterol, and Hba1c. The morning response of SDNN was most indicative
of MACE, with the strongest association observed from 6--7 AM (IRR:
0.84; 95\% CI: 0.71 to 1.00 per SD higher SDNN) (see
Figure~\ref{fig-ADD_PRO_risk_by_hour} A)\textsuperscript{83}. Heart rate
between 12 AM and 6 AM showed a small trend toward higher risk of MACE
(IRR range: 1.11 to 1.15 per SD higher heart rate), although none of the
confidence intervals exceeded one (see
Figure~\ref{fig-ADD_PRO_risk_by_hour} D)\textsuperscript{83}. Across all
hours, there was a plausible association between SDNN and heart failure.
However, this association disappeared after adjusting for physical
acceleration and heart rate (see Figure~\ref{fig-ADD_PRO_risk_by_hour}
B)\textsuperscript{83}. In contrast, heart rate between 10 PM and 9 AM
was associated with heart failure (IRR range: 1.37 to 1.58 per SD higher
heart rate) (see Figure~\ref{fig-ADD_PRO_risk_by_hour} E). SDNN was
consistently associated with all-cause mortality across all hours, with
a stronger inverse association observed between 12 PM and 1 AM (IRR
range: 0.79 to 0.88 per SD higher SDNN) (see
Figure~\ref{fig-ADD_PRO_risk_by_hour} C)\textsuperscript{83}. No clear
trends of association were observed between heart rate and all-cause

In study III, 179 participants with type 2 had measures of NT-proBNP and

participants (36\% among those with valid CAN measurements
(Figure~\ref{fig-CAN} A)). Meanwhile, 24\% (n = 43) were unable to
complete the CART assessment adequately, primarily due to irregular
heart rhythms (n = 8) or insufficient air pressure during the Valsalva

CAN were more women (41 \% vs 33 \%), were more sedentary (45\% vs
36\%), had a higher proportion with prior major CVD (41\% vs 20\%) and
declined eGFR (\textless{} 60) (36\% vs 22\%), higher levels of
triglyceride (median 2.05 mmol/L vs 1.95 mmol/ L), were slightly older
(median 62 years vs 61 years), had longer duration of T2D (median 19
years vs 15 years), and higher use SGTL2-inhibitors (65\% vs 60\%) but
lower use of GLP-1 RA (63\% vs 70\%). No other difference in clinical
characteristic was observed.

A greater proportion of individuals with CAN exhibited elevated

those without CAN (23.2\%, n=26/112)(Figure~\ref{fig-CAN}

NT-proBNP in individuals with CAN was 5.69 (95\% CI: 1.95; 18.49)
relative to those without CAN\textsuperscript{84}. Among the
cardiovascular autonomic reflex tests (CART), the Valsalva maneuver
demonstrated the strongest association with NT-proBNP (OR 9.00, 95\% CI:
2.88; 33.09; n=51/75), followed by deep breathing (OR 3.30, 95\% CI:

was identified for the lying-to-standing test (OR 0.80, 95\% CI: 0.32;

the OR for CAN in relation to elevated NT-proBNP declined to 2.94 (95\%
CI: 1.37; 6.56). Sensitivity analyses, which excluded participants using
beta-blockers or those with a history of CVD, resulted in a smaller
sample size and wider confidence intervals, though the overall
association remained unchanged\textsuperscript{84}. CAN was associated
with elevated NT-proBNP in individuals both without (NYHA I; OR = 4.3,
95\% CI: 1.1; 16.3) and with heart failure symptoms (NYHA ≥ II; OR =
16.4, 95\% CI: 1.2; 222.0), though the interaction was not significant
(p = 0.4)\textsuperscript{84}. Similar associations were seen across
WATCH-DM risk groups: very-low-to-moderate (OR = 6.1, 95\% CI: 1.6;

\newpage

The aim of this dissertation is to understand how cardiovascular
autonomic dysfunction and CAN affect the risk of CVD across stages of
glucose metabolism. Given the rising prevalence of prediabetes and T2D,
and their association with increased risks of CVD and heart failure,
there is a pressing need for earlier indicators to help healthcare
providers intervene in a timely manner and prevent progression to more
advanced stages of cardiovascular complications. One promising approach
involves leveraging data from wearable devices and standardized
screening tools. Heart rate dynamics and variability across different
circumstances may hold promise as accessible indicators for early
cardiovascular risk stratification.

This chapter presents a summary of the main findings from this
dissertation, interpreted in the context of existing evidence in the
field, and discusses their clinical relevance across different levels of
healthcare. Moreover, the strengths and limitations of the methods and
results will be discussed.

\hypertarget{summary-of-findings}{%
\section{Summary of findings}\label{summary-of-findings}}

In this dissertation, autonomic dysfunction, defined by long-term HRV
and standardized CARTs, and its relationship with cardiovascular
complications were studied across three different cohorts representing
populations at varying levels of prevention and care, including public
health, primary care, and secondary care. In The Maastricht Study (Study
I), I investigated autonomic dysfunction, measured by 24-hour HRV, and
arterial stiffness, measured dynamically along the descending aorta and
locally at the carotid site among individuals with NGM, prediabetes, and
T2D. Lower HRV was associated with higher aortic and carotid stiffness.
This association was evident regardless of glucose metabolism status,
and was more pronounced in individuals with prediabetes or T2D. The
modifying effect of dysglycemia was confirmed by a statistically
significant stronger association across higher HbA1c levels. Z-scores of
time- and frequency-domain measures showed the strongest associations,
primarily driven by HRV indices reflecting total variation in interbeat
intervals (SDNN, SDANN, SDNN index, ULF, VLF, TP).

Study II focused on individuals at higher risk of developing diabetes,
using data from the ADDITION-PRO cohort. In study II, lower SDNN,
measured over a multiple days, was associated with 18\%, 24\%, and 21\%
higher risk per SD for ischemic-related CVD, hospitalization of heart
failure, and all-cause mortality, respectively. The risk became higher
at SDNN levels below 120 ms, supported by a greater difference in
incidence rates between individuals with 100 ms and 120 ms than the
difference observed between individuals with 120 ms and 160 ms. Hourly
measures suggested a specific time point related to ischemic-related
CVD, as lower SDNN recorded between 6:00 and 7:00 AM was associated with
MACE. Adjustment using the residuals method for concurrent heart rate
and physical movement did not explain the observed association. Hourly
SDNN was associated with all-cause MRR, although no specific time point
showed an exceptionally strong association. While no association between
hourly SDNN and heart failure was observed, higher heart rate during the
night hours from 02:00 to 06:00 AM was linked to an higher risk of heart
failure hospitalization.

These findings suggest that both long-term HRV measures and hourly HRV
responses may serve as indicators of CVD risk. However, a key
observation is that long-term HRV was assessed under free-living
conditions, which restricts the comparability of results to standardized
tests of autonomic function, although it provides insights that are more
comparable to what may be found with long-term wearable devices. In the
CANCAN Study (Study III), standardized CARTs were used to define CAN and
to describe indicators of heart failure, including elevated NT-proBNP,
WATCH-DM risk, and NYHA classification, among individuals with and
without CAN in a population with T2D. In CANCAN, two out of five had
CAN. Compared to individuals without CAN, theses individuals more often
showed signs of heart failure, including elevated NT-proBNP levels,
higher WATCH-DM risk scores, and higher classifications on the NYHA. CAN
was association elevated NT-proBNP levels and these persisted even among
individuals without heart failure symptoms based on NYHA classification,
as well as among those categorized as having low to moderate heart
failure risk according to the WATCH-DM score.

In summary, various aspects of autonomic dysfunction and cardiovascular
complications were investigated in populations with normal glucose
metabolism, prediabetes, or T2D. The overall findings showed that
autonomic function, assessed through heart rate dynamics of long-term
HRV and diurnal HRV or heart rate responses to reflex tests, is
associated with an increased risk of CVD and heart failure. This
relationship appears to be stronger in more severe stages of
dysglycemia. Moreover, among individuals with T2D, the presence of CAN
may help identify those at higher risk of heart failure, even in the
absence of heart failure symptoms.

\section{Cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction and its impact on heart
disease across glucose
metabolism}\label{cardiovascular-autonomic-dysfunction-and-its-impact-on-heart-disease-across-glucose-metabolism}}

This dissertation shows that autonomic dysfunction, measured by HRV and
CARTs, is associated with CVD risk across the spectrum of glucose
metabolism dysregulation. This association is evident with measures of
arteriosclerosis, atherosclerotic events, all-cause mortality, and heart
failure in individuals at high risk of diabetes, as well as with
indicators of heart failure in patients with T2D.

\hypertarget{arteriosclerosis-1}{%
\subsubsection{Arteriosclerosis}\label{arteriosclerosis-1}}

In Study I, autonomic dysfunction, measured by 24-hour HRV, showed to be
associated with arterial stiffness, measured both dynamically (cf-PWV)
and locally (CD). This suggests that autonomic responses under
free-living conditions contribute to the development of arterial
stiffness. The majority of studies in the field have shown an
association between autonomic dysfunction, as measured by short-term HRV
during rest, and arterial stiffness in populations with either type 1 or
T2D.\textsuperscript{85}. Study I extended this perspective by examining
long-term HRV and focusing on a population without diabetes or
prediabetes.

\end{figure}

Arterial stiffness is not only a structural marker of vascular ageing
but is also dynamically modulated by local endothelial signals and
autonomic nervous system activity. Several studies have demonstrated a
link between elevated sympathetic tone and increased arterial
stiffness{[}\textsuperscript{86}{]}\textsuperscript{87}. Two possible
mechanisms may explain how autonomic dysfunction is related to arterial
stiffness. First, autonomic dysfunction may increase the vascular tone
of large arteries, thereby impairing arterial elasticity dynamically.
This concept is supported by animal studies. In rats, proper autonomic
regulation has been shown to be essential for maintaining aortic
elasticity. Based on this mechanism, the association between autonomic
dysfunction and arterial stiffness might be considered an immediate, and
likely transient effect, expected to reverse if autonomic function is
restored. Conversely, chronic overstimulation of sympathetic activity
can lead to structural remodeling and increased arterial
stiffness\textsuperscript{88}. While such findings cannot be directly
extrapolated to humans, they suggest plausible biological pathways.
Although the initial effects of autonomic dysfunction are dynamic and
amenable to change by intervention, they may become progressively less
reversible over time{[}\textsuperscript{88}{]}\textsuperscript{89}.
Second, the autonomic nervous system regulates heart rate and cardiac
contractility. Autonomic dysfunction typically manifests as both reduced
HRV and elevated resting heart rate. Arterial shear stress increases as
a result of heightened sympathetic activity and parasympathetic
withdrawal. A higher resting heart rate may contribute to structurally
stiffer arteries by altering blood flow dynamics and by increasing shear
stress. Our earlier study using data from the Whitehall II cohort showed
that a steeper decrease in short-term (5-minute) HRV over a ten-year
period was linked with higher levels of aortic stiffness in the
subsequent five years\textsuperscript{90}.

The association between 24-hour HRV and arterial stiffness (Study II)
was modified by dysglycemia, suggesting dysclycemia may induce CAN that
can affect arterial stiffness, even before the onset of
T2D{[}\textsuperscript{91}{]}\textsuperscript{92}\textsuperscript{93}.
Data from the Whitehall II study showed that aortic stiffness increased
more steeply with higher HbA1c values among non-diabetic
individuals\textsuperscript{94}, supporting this notion. In the
subpopulation in Study I without diabetes, a modification by HbA1c in
both aortic and carotid stiffness was observed. The modifying effect of
HbA1c suggests that hyperglycaemia amplifies the consequences of
autonomic dysfunction.

\hypertarget{atherosclerosis-1}{%
\subsubsection{Atherosclerosis}\label{atherosclerosis-1}}

Study II showed that individuals with a preclinical stage of autonomic
dysfunction, measured by multiday HRV, face a higher risk of incident
ischemic CVD, heart failure, and all-cause mortality.

Multiday HRV was assessed to capture autonomic activity in real-life
settings across several days. Our results are consistent with earlier
research linking lower HRV (including measures from 10 seconds to 24
hours) to CVD and mortality
{[}\textsuperscript{95}{]}\textsuperscript{5}. Our findings build on
existing evidence by (1) focusing on a population at elevated risk of
diabetes, (2) utilizing multiday HRV recordings, and (3) identifying
specific periods within the day where HRV patterns were indicative of
ischemic-related CVD risk. By using both week-long and hourly data, we
identified specific periods that provide a better indication of
long-term risk. A strength of using multiday HRV recordings, is to
provide more robust insights into individual autonomic patterns by
averaging autonomic responses across typical daily conditions. This
reduces the influence of random fluctuations caused by factors such as
physical activity, emotional states, or sleep on any single
day\textsuperscript{96}.

Multiple mechanisms may explain how autonomic dysfunction contributes to
the initiation and progression of ischemic events and stroke. First, as
discussed in Study I, autonomic dysfunction may promote
arteriosclerosis, leading to arterial stiffness through a dynamic and
potentially modifiable process. Arterial stiffness impairs vasodilation,
increasing hemodynamic stress and the risk of plaque rupture and
thrombus formation {[}\textsuperscript{97}{]}\textsuperscript{98}. In
this context, findings from Study I may not entirely distinguish between
arterial stiffness and atherosclerosis, as shown by data from the
Rotterdam Study\textsuperscript{99}. As plaques develop, the associated
increase in sympathetic nerve density around the arteries could
transiently reduce vascular tone which over time reduce arterial
elasticity\textsuperscript{100}. In a smaller study of people with T2D,
lower HRV was linked with increased carotid
atherosclerosis\textsuperscript{101}.

Second, the autonomic nervous system innervates the adventitia layer of
blood vessels, where it modulates vascular tone via sympathetic fibres.
Although atherosclerotic plaques form in the intima layer, recent in
vivo studies have demonstrated that increased plaque burden is
associated with higher local sympathetic nerve density, likely mediated
by neuroinflammatory processes. Notably, reducing sympathetic
innervation has been shown to attenuate plaque formation in animal
models\textsuperscript{102}. These findings suggest that autonomic
dysfunction may not only reflect but also actively contribute to
atherogenesis.

Third, autonomic nervous dysfunction has been shown to interfere with
signalling pathways controlling heart rhythm, potentially leading to
arrhythmias that disturb cardiac contraction. Ealier studies have shwon
lower short-term HRV was associated with incident atrial fibrillation
(AF), with a higher risk among participants with T2D
{[}\textsuperscript{95}{]}\textsuperscript{103}. This supports the role
of autonomic dysfunction in arrhythmogenesis, which increases the risk
of myocardial infarction and stroke. Study II did not include AF as an
outcome due to limitations in Danish registries, which often do not
distinguish between short- and long-term AF, thereby affecting
diagnostic validity.

A study of individuals with coronary artery disease showed that
stress-induced HRV was associated with myocardial infarction, even more
than resting HRV, suggesting that lower parasympathetic modulation of
heart rate under stress may play a role in
ischemia\textsuperscript{104}. Our study focused on long-term HRV under
free-living conditions, capturing stress-responsive periods such as
morning awakening. These recordings likely reflect underlying autonomic
dynamics relevant to cardiovascular risk. A Genome-Wide Association
Study (GWAS) in the UK biobank of short-term HRV supports this by
identifying mechanisms involving G-protein signaling, pacemaker
activity, and mitochondrial function as likely mediators of the genetic
contribution to HRV. These pathways influence vagal control, cardiac
excitability, and energy metabolism\textsuperscript{105}. Although
derived from short-term recordings, these genetic associations may
reflect autonomic traits that persist across different time scales, and
reinforce the notion of a biological basis for inter-individual
differences in HRV, preceding and independent of the onset of
dysglaecemia. A Mendelian randomization study using data from the
Rotterdam Study found that genetically predicted HRV was associated with
an higher risk of AF\textsuperscript{106}. However, this association did
not extend to all-cause mortality or cardiovascular death in the UK
Biobank cohort, where only phenotypically measured HRV showed a
significant relationship with these outcomes\textsuperscript{107}.
Interestingly, the genetic determinants of HRV exhibited pleiotropic
relationships with several autonomic traits, including resting heart
rate, heart rate response during exercise, and post-exercise recovery
dynamics\textsuperscript{107}. No GWAS has yet been conducted for
long-term HRV. Therefore, it is unclear whether the genetic influences
identified for short-term HRV are applicable to long-term HRV. Future
GWAS efforts targeting long-term HRV could help establish causal
relationships to CVD by leveraging methods such as Mendelian
randomization, and advancing our understanding of the genetic
architecture underlying autonomic regulation under a full day.

\hypertarget{heart-failure-1}{%
\subsubsection{Heart failure}\label{heart-failure-1}}

The relationship between cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction and heart
failure is complex\textsuperscript{108}. On one hand, autonomic
dysfunction contributes to cardiac remodelling and eventual heart
failure. On the other hand, it may reflect compensatory mechanisms of
the progression of cardiac remodelling and declining cardiac output. Our
findings demonstrated a relationship between autonomic dysfunction and
heart failure both cross-sectionally in a population with T2D and
prospectively in individuals representing different tiers of diabetes
risk. However, our data are limited in determining the extent to which
this relationship supports one explanation over the other, as we lack
baseline and follow-up measures of both heart failure and HRV. Earlier
studies have demonstrated that both short-term and long-term HRV are
associated with incident heart failure in populations with and without
T2D.{[}\textsuperscript{109}{]}\textsuperscript{110}{[}\textsuperscript{111}{]}\textsuperscript{112}.
Beyond examining a population at elevated risk of diabetes using
multiday HRV recordings, we expanded previous research by (1) unmasking
the role of resting heart rate in the relationship between HRV and heart
failure risk, and (2) identifying specific times of day when heart rate
patterns signaled higher risk of heart failure.

Several mechanisms may underlie the role of autonomic dysfunction in
advancing heart failure. Findings from Study I confirmed the
relationship between autonomic dysfunction and arterial stiffness. It is
well established that arterial stiffness is linked to cardiac
remodelling, as increased cf-PWV leads to an earlier return of the
reflected pulse wave to the aorta, which increases cardiac afterload and
reduces coronary perfusion pressure\textsuperscript{113}. Therefore,
autonomic dysfunction may have an indirect effect on heart failure,
potentially mediated by arterial stiffness. However, structured analyses
are needed to confirm these pathways. For example, mediation analysis
with repeated measurements could be employed to assess the temporal
direct and indirect effects of autonomic dysfunction on measures of
cardiac remodeling, with arterial stiffness as the mediator.

Study II showed that multiday HRV was associated with incident heart
failure, and approximately one-fourth of the risk was explained by
resting heart rate. Data from the Rotterdam Study showed that short-term
HRV was longitudinally associated with echocardiographic measures
reflecting systolic function, suggesting that autonomic dysfunction
contributes to cardiac remodelling\textsuperscript{114}. In contrast to
MACE outcomes, findings from Study II showed no specific time point in
hourly HRV that was associated with heart failure. Instead, it was the
overall daily pattern captured by multiday HRV that was linked to heart
failure risk. This suggests that the association is not driven by
isolated shifts in autonomic activity in response to circadian
stressors, but rather by a consistently impaired autonomic balance under
free-living conditions. The effect appears to be driven in part by a
failure to show appropriate decreases in heart rate during rest, as
individuals with higher hourly heart rates at night had an higher risk
of heart failure. In Study III, I observed that individuals with CAN had
higher risk of elevated levels of NT-proBNP, a biomarker of myocardial
stress and early heart failure. Therefore, CAN is associated with
hemodynamic consequences that contribute to both structural and
functional cardiac remodeling, which in turn leads to elevated NT-proBNP
levels.

We cannot rule out that autonomic dysfunction reflects a compensatory
response to progressing heart failure, suggesting potential reverse
causation. In addition, it remains unclear to what extent the
parasympathetic nervous system can act as a protective mechanism to
counterbalance sympathetic dominance, and whether a decline in HRV
reflects a breakdown of this balance. The two pathways (autonomic
neuropathy and cardiac remodelling) are not mutually exclusive and may
interact in a reinforcing cycle. Autonomic dysfunction can lead to
increased sympathetic tone and reduced parasympathetic modulation,
placing the heart under chronic stress and promoting structural and
functional changes\textsuperscript{24}. In turn, cardiac remodelling may
impair autonomic regulation, further exacerbating the imbalance. This
interplay may create a self-perpetuating loop that accelerates the
progression of heart failure. However, this remains beyond the scope of
our current data and analysis.

\hypertarget{clinical-implications}{%
\section{Clinical implications}\label{clinical-implications}}

The dissertation investigates autonomic dysfunction in populations
ranging from normal glucose metabolism to T2D and yields insights
relevant for individuals who engage with the healthcare system at
different levels. No specific role has yet been defined for autonomic
dysfunction in clinical decision-making within healthcare, as current
treatment and intervention options specifically targeting autonomic
function remain limited. Despite the fact that the results do not point
directly to where and how implementation of autonomic dysfunction in
clinical practice may make sense, the included studies broadly represent
situations relevant to public health, primary care, and secondary care
settings. In the following section, the clinical implications of using
autonomic dysfunction in the prevention of CVD will be discussed. If
long-term HRV or CARTs are to be considered for improving risk
stratification, it is important to determine at what stage in the
progression of diabetes risk, and at which level of care, autonomic
dysfunction becomes meaningful for early detection and intervention.

\hypertarget{public-health}{%
\subsection{Public health}\label{public-health}}

A central strategy in preventing CVD is the early identification and
multifactorial treatment of individuals at high
risk\textsuperscript{115}. Public health initiatives support this by
promoting healthy lifestyles, facilitating early screening for risk
factors, and improving access to essential care and medications.
Long-term HRV may enhance these efforts by identifying individuals with
elevated cardiovascular risk and by tracking their physiological
response to lifestyle changes.

Evidence from Study I showed that lower long-term HRV was associated
with increased arterial stiffness, as measured by cf-PWV and CD, even in
individuals without T2D. One standard deviation lower HRV corresponded
to the effect of 2.7 additional years of ageing on aortic stiffness
(cf-PWV) and 1.6 years on carotid stiffness (CD)\textsuperscript{69}.
These cross-sectional findings suggest that HRV may serve as a marker of
early vascular aging and cardiovascular risk. Supporting this, the
Whitehall II study demonstrated a longitudinal relationship between
short-term HRV and aortic stiffness. Together, these findings highlight
the potential of HRV as a indicator of vascular health.

Within the public health setting, individuals with prediabetes represent
a particularly vulnerable group at risk for
comorbidities\textsuperscript{116}. They often fall between structured
care pathways, sometimes encouraged to reassess their cardiovascular
risk at more frequent intervals, other times not offered any additional
measures or attention beyond general lifestyle advice. Notably, Studies
I and II demonstrated that the associations between long-term HRV and
CVD risk were especially pronounced in this population. In those at high
risk of diabetes, a one standard deviation (33 ms) lower multiday SDNN
was equivalent to 4.5 additional years of aging for ischemic-related CVD
and 2.2 to 2.4 years for heart failure\textsuperscript{83}. On a
population level, lower HRV (SDNN: 100 ms) in individuals with
prediabetes was associated with a higher incidence rate of CVD, heart
failure, and all-cause mortality compared to individuals with
normal-to-higher HRV (SDNN: 120--160 ms). These findings reinforce the
role of HRV as an early and sensitive marker of cardiovascular health in
populations at cardiometabolic risk.

While these findings highlight HRV's potential, practical implementation
faces several challenges. Historically, long-term HRV monitoring has
required specialized equipment such as Holter ECG recorders. However,
the growing popularity of wearable devices offers a promising
alternative. These devices provide a non-invasive, user-friendly way to
collect heart rate and HRV data over time\textsuperscript{11}, under
free-living conditions like those examined in Study II.

If HRV monitoring proves effective in helping individuals maintain a
healthy, age-adjusted HRV range through lifestyle changes and prompts
healthcare engagement when HRV deteriorates, it could become a
meaningful tool for long-term health tracking. A cross-sectional study
of 8 million individuals found that those who took more steps per day
had higher HRV\textsuperscript{13}, suggesting that HRV may also reflect
behavioral adaptation.

A major public health challenge lies in ensuring equitable access to
wearable technology. Individuals from lower socioeconomic backgrounds
are less likely to own such devices, raising concerns about health
disparities. Despite this, there is encouraging evidence that the
general population is receptive to digital health innovations. Many are
willing to share health data with public institutions and support the
use of AI in disease
monitoring{[}\textsuperscript{11}{]}\textsuperscript{117}.

Integrating wearable HRV monitoring into public health strategies could
represent a transformative step in proactive cardiovascular care. It may
support early detection, personalized prevention, and timely referral to
primary care when risk levels increase.

\hypertarget{primary-care}{%
\subsection{Primary care}\label{primary-care}}

Cardiovascular risk in primary care is assessed using clinical
evaluations and standardized risk prediction tools to identify
individuals at elevated risk. Management focuses on lifestyle
modification, pharmacological therapy, and regular monitoring to reduce
cardiovascular events\textsuperscript{118}. In this context, long-term
HRV may offer added value by improving the precision of cardiovascular
risk stratification and by serving as a marker to monitor the
effectiveness of preventive strategies.

Long-term HRV may improve ranking of individual risk when added to
established clinical risk scores. Tools such as SCORE2 and the
Framingham Risk Score are widely used in primary care to guide
cardiovascular risk assessment\textsuperscript{119,120}. In Study I,
models adjusted for conventional CVD risk factors supported the
potential added value of 24-hour HRV in relation to arterial stiffness,
a surrogate marker of CVD risk. Study II extended this perspective by
demonstrating associations between multiday HRV and incident CVD and
heart failure. However, these findings are based on associations and do
not include formal prediction modeling\textsuperscript{121}, and
therefore cannot determine whether incorporating long-term HRV or CARTs
into existing risk scores improves predictive performance beyond current
guidelines. This analysis is limited in ADDITION-PRO, as the cohort
doesn't reflect high-risk groups typically identified in primary care,
such as those with elevated HbA1c. Similarly, CANCAN is constrained by
its small sample size and selection from secondary care. To properly
assess predictive value, cohorts should broadly represent individuals
with T2D or those at high risk, as identified by current clinical
practice. While most biomarkers have shown limited incremental value
beyond established predictors (including age, sex, lipid profiles,
diabetes status, and blood pressure), some studies suggest that 24-hour
HRV may improve risk discrimination for CVD and all-cause mortality in
individuals with T2D\textsuperscript{122}, and for stroke and heart
failure in older adults{[}\textsuperscript{109}{]}\textsuperscript{123}.
However, these studies often lack calibration or validation in
large-scale cohorts and have not been integrated with widely used risk
scores such as SCORE2 or the Framingham Risk Score.

Long-term HRV may also help classify preclinical autonomic dysfunction,
enabling targeted interventions in a subgroup of patients to prevent
CVD. The increasing availability of wearable devices capable of
capturing long-term HRV data presents a practical opportunity for
continuous monitoring in primary care. These devices may facilitate
earlier detection of autonomic dysfunction and support more personalized
approaches to cardiovascular risk management. However, the clinical
utility of stratifying patients based on preclinical autonomic
dysfunction remains uncertain. These considerations are only actionable
if interventions in this subgroup can be shown to reduce cardiovascular
risk. Emerging evidence suggests that both pharmacological and lifestyle
interventions can improve HRV in the short
term\textsuperscript{124,125}. For example, high-intensity interval
training has been shown to improve autonomic function in obese
individuals with and without T2D\textsuperscript{126}. Similarly,
lifestyle changes in individuals with prediabetes have been associated
with improvements in short-term HRV, which may partly explain a
reduction in diabetes risk independently of weight
loss\textsuperscript{127}. Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether
these effects on HRV are sustainable over time and whether they
translate into long-term cardiovascular protection. In many cases,
improvements in autonomic function may be mediated indirectly through
changes in cardiometabolic markers such as glucose levels, lipid
profiles, body weight, maximal oxygen uptake, and blood pressure.

Despite these uncertainties, monitoring autonomic function through
long-term HRV may offer a valuable tool for assessing cardiovascular
risk and tracking the impact of preventive strategies. In Denmark,
prediabetes, defined by HbA1c, is present in 7.1\% of
adults\textsuperscript{128}. One in five of these individuals develops
T2D within five years\textsuperscript{128}, while others either remain
in the prediabetic stage or return to normoglycemia. Despite their
higher risk of CVD and heart failure\textsuperscript{129}, individuals
with prediabetes are not captured by existing preventive strategies.
This underscores the need for early and precise risk
assessment\textsuperscript{10}. Given that the cardiovascular
consequences of autonomic dysfunction appear to be more pronounced in
individuals with prediabetes compared to those with normoglycemia, HRV
has the potential to help identify those at elevated CVD risk within
this group. However, evidence demonstrating improved risk prediction and
sustained effects leading to better cardiovascular outcomes is needed to
establish its relevance for integration into primary care.

\hypertarget{secondary-care}{%
\subsection{Secondary care}\label{secondary-care}}

In secondary care, endocrinologists assess cardiovascular and heart
failure risk by integrating advanced diagnostics, biomarker analysis,
and imaging to detect early heart failure, guided by symptoms and risk
profiles. The treatment of patients with T2D is guided by evidence-based
therapies and multidisciplinary collaboration. The ADA/EASD 2022
consensus on Management of Hyperglycemia in T2D emphasizes that early
detection of heart failure in individuals with T2D is crucial, as it
enables timely initiation of therapies such as SGLT2 inhibitors, which
have demonstrated significant benefits in reducing heart failure-related
outcomes\textsuperscript{130}. A major challenge in diabetes care is
detecting heart failure before symptoms appear, as patients with
symptomatic heart failure face a higher risk of mortality and more
frequent hospitalizations\textsuperscript{4}. The AHA, ACC, and HFSA
2022 guidelines recommend identifying individuals at risk of heart
failure based on factors such as diabetes, poor glycaemic control,
uncontrolled hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, elevated BMI, albuminuria,
renal dysfunction, and a history of CVD\textsuperscript{56}. Still,
there is a need to identify optimal approaches for recognizing and
diagnosing heart failure in clinical care, as broad echocardiographic
screening in T2D is time-consuming and costly\textsuperscript{4}.

Study III demonstrated that CAN may help identify individuals at higher
risk of heart failure, beyond what is captured by symptoms or existing
risk scores. Our findings support considering CAN as a relevant risk
factor for heart failure and suggest it may have value in future risk
stratification strategies in T2D. A clinical advantage of using CARTs is
that they are standardized tests performed under controlled conditions.
CARTs have proven to be reliable and reproducible, with reference values
established in large population studies\textsuperscript{65}. Beyond
these findings and the established evidence of increased heart failure
risk, CAN also identifies individuals at high risk for overall CVD,
kidney disease, and early mortality in the T2D
population{[}\textsuperscript{61}{]}\textsuperscript{62}. In Study III,
I observed that two out of five participants had CAN, highlighting it as
a complication with considerable prevalence. Therefore, detecting CAN
may uncover an often-overlooked condition that is common in individuals
with T2D.

Clinical stratification of care includes two key considerations: (1) CAN
should be further evaluated for associated cardiovascular complications,
such as heart failure; and (2) cardiopreventive strategies should be
initiated earlier in this subgroup.

First, patients with CAN may benefit from further cardiovascular
assessment, including the use of sensitive biomarkers or
echocardiography. NT-proBNP is a strong predictor of heart failure and a
validated biomarker for ruling out the condition (ref.). However, its
specificity varies across heart failure phenotypes, being less specific
for detecting HFpEF compared to HFrEF. Therefore, additional evaluation
using echocardiography may be warranted. Beyond classifying heart
failure phenotypes, echocardiography identifies preclinical stages of
heart failure through the detection of functional or structural cardiac
abnormalities. Including CAN in structured assessments of heart failure
could help clarify to which extent CAN overlaps with cardiac
abnormalities. Determining the diagnostic and prognostic value of CAN,
particularly its sensitivity and specificity in detecting HFrEF and
HFpEF, requires further investigation.

Second, the presence of CAN may justify earlier initiation of protective
therapies. SGLT2 inhibitors are recommended as second-line treatment in
T2D and have demonstrated benefits in reducing the risk of heart
failure, CVD, and kidney function decline, complications commonly
associated with CAN. Current guidelines recommend initiating these
therapies based on a history of CVD, heart failure, or the presence of
conventional high-risk cardiovascular factors. However, the specific
impact of SGLT2 inhibitors on the progression of cardiorenal outcomes in
patients with CAN remains to be fully understood. Furthermore, while
antihypertensive treatment is a cornerstone of cardiovascular risk
management, whether specific classes of antihypertensive agents offer
protective effects in patients with CAN remains to be explored.

The direct clinical implications of our findings in Study III are
limited. The generalizability of our results is restricted, as our study
population consisted of patients with T2D receiving secondary care. Two
out of five patients with CAN showed to have a history of CVD---a group
already at higher risk of heart failure due to their prior diagnosis.
This overlap may influence the interpretation of CAN as an independent
risk factor. Therefore, these findings need to be validated in a broader
population with T2D, including individuals without a history of CVD.
Doing so would allow for greater generalizability of our results to the
broader T2D population, particularly those visiting primary care.

\hypertarget{strengths-and-limitations}{%
\section{Strengths and limitations}\label{strengths-and-limitations}}

\hypertarget{study-design}{%
\subsection{Study design}\label{study-design}}

\emph{Cross-sectional design}

Studies I and III are based on cross-sectional data, with exposure and
outcome measured within a three-month period. The main limitation of
this design is that it does not allow us to determine whether the
exposure led to the outcome or vice versa. As a result, we cannot
establish temporality or confirm whether changes in the outcome were
caused by the exposure. Based on prior evidence, the direction of the
associations in Study I was inferred using physiological knowledge and
findings from epidemiological and in vivo studies\textsuperscript{90}.

Study III focused on the clinical diagnosis of CAN and the presence of
heart failure. The research question was oriented toward the clinical
utility of CAN in identifying patients with T2D who may be progressing
early toward heart failure. Whether cardiac function progressively
worsens due to the underlying mechanisms of CAN remains to be fully
established.

\emph{Longitudinal design}

A major strength of Study II is its longitudinal design, where HRV was
measured at baseline and outcomes were captured prospectively through
national registries. This temporal structure ensures that the exposure
(HRV) preceded the outcome, reducing the risk of reverse causation. The
prospective design allows for stronger inference of directionality than
cross-sectional studies. Furthermore, the use of high-quality registry
data ensures complete outcome ascertainment and minimizes loss to
follow-up bias.

Causality cannot be ascertained from the findings in Study I and Study
II, and more causally focused methods are needed. Mendelian
randomization, which uses genetic instruments for exposure, could help
address this question. Additionally, structured mediation analysis
involving modifications such as medication or lifestyle changes could
clarify whether improving HRV or CART reduces cardiovascular risk, using
data from intervention studies.

\hypertarget{internal-validity}{%
\subsection{Internal validity}\label{internal-validity}}

In this project, I aimed to assess cardiovascular autonomic function
both in free-living conditions and in response to standardized test
procedures during clinical visits. Additionally, I used dynamic
measurements to evaluate arterial stiffness both locally and by
velocity, and biomarker assessments to determine the presence of heart
failure. In this section, I discuss the validity of 24-hour, multiday,
and hourly HRV measurements, as well as the standardized tests of CAN. I
also address the validity of the included outcomes and discuss the
strengths and limitations of using MACE as a time-to-event outcome.

\hypertarget{long-term-hrv-24-hours-as-measurement-for-autonomic-function}{%
\subsubsection{Long-term HRV (\textgreater24 hours) as measurement for
autonomic
function}\label{long-term-hrv-24-hours-as-measurement-for-autonomic-function}}

A main consideration in HRV analysis is the reliability of raw
inter-beat interval data from ECG recordings. To ensure accurate various
HRV measures, the intervals must be captured in a continuous and
correctly sequenced manner. Frequency-domain analyses depend on the
integrity of the inter-beat interval sequence, while some time-domain
measures, such as RMSSD and pNN50, specifically quantify the variability
in the differences between successive intervals.

In Study I, data from a 12-lead Holter system was used, which is
considered the gold standard for long-term ECG recordings. With detailed
and sequential inter-beat intervals, all HRV metrics were calcualted.

In Study II, data from the Actiheart device was used for HRV. The device
was configured to record continuously over an 8-day period. It captured
30-second epochs of mean heart rate intervals, along with upper and
lower prediction intervals. From each epoch, I generated a distribution
of inter-beat intervals. An algorithm was applied to estimate HRV from
these distributions, and its validation showed strong agreement with
established metrics, including SDNN, SDANN, and the SDNN index
{[}\textsuperscript{6}{]}\textsuperscript{78}. However, a limitation of
this dataset is that it did not allow for the calculation of
frequency-domain measures or specific time-domain metrics such as RMSSD
or pNN50.

In the context of this study, which focuses on long-term HRV in
free-living conditions, it is important to acknowledge that the
autonomic nervous function we aim to assess may also be influenced by
behavioral factors such as physical activity, sleep, meal timing,
emotions, smoking, caffeine intake, alcohol consumption, medication use,
and prior cardiovascular complications. These factors can potentially
mask or mimic underlying physiological dysfunction during recordings,
but they can also elicit the HRV responses we are interested in.
Therefore, lower long-term HRV cannot be interpreted solely as a marker
of autonomic function. HRV is also influenced by lifestyle patterns over
time, making it sensitive not only to day-to-day behaviors but also to
long-term habits that affect autonomic balance.

In Studies I and II, I accounted for habitual physical activity, and in
Study II, I also adjusted hourly HRV for physical movement during
recordings to test the influence of concurrent activity. However,
further studies are needed to understand how lifestyle patterns affect
long-term HRV recordings on subsequent days, in order to separate direct
behavioural from physiological components. In both studies, I excluded
participants with prior CVD to preserve the etiological order between
autonomic dysfunction and cardiovascular outcomes.

Anti-hypertensive medications, especially beta-blockers, are known to
increase HRV in randomized controlled trials\textsuperscript{131}.
However, in cohort studies, participants using anti-hypertensives
generally show lower HRV, likely reflecting a higher burden of
cardiovascular complications {[}ref{]}. Because beta-blockers target the
autonomic nervous system, they may introduce bias in HRV measurements by
interfering with the function. In sensitivity analyses in Studies I and
III, excluding participants on anti-hypertensive treatment did not
materially change the estimates. Therefore, these participants where
kept and adjusted for medication use in the full models.

Beyond the behavioral and pharmacological contribution to HRV, we cannot
physiologically distinguish whether autonomic dysfunction is primarily
driven by increased sympathetic activity or reduced parasympathetic
tone. Much of the current evidence on autonomic contributions to HRV
originates from studies involving experimental manipulation of the
autonomic nervous system, such as physiological tests (e.g., tilt
response, deep breathing, stress response) or pharmacological
interventions. Therefore, it remains uncertain whether the mechanisms
linking HRV indices to cardiovascular complications are predominantly
due to sympathetic over activity or parasympathetic withdrawal.

HRV levels are influenced by heart rate, as lower resting heart rate
allows for greater variability. In Study I, I chose not to adjust for
heart rate in our models, as this could introduce multicollinearity.
Additionally, elevated heart rate is driven by higher sympathetic
activity and may act as a mediator in the pathway leading to arterial
stiffness. Our use of full-day recordings captures HRV during both rest
and activity, providing a robust representation of autonomic function
over a typical day. In contrast, heart rate correction may be more
relevant for short-term HRV recordings, where standardized conditions
can be affected by random influences such as time of day, smoking, or
caffeine intake. These factors would have been relevant in Study III had
I included HRV measures. In Study II, I usesd the residuals method to
pre-adjust HRV measures for resting heart rate, which accounted for part
of the observed associations, particularly with heart failure and
all-cause mortality, and to a lesser extent with ischemic-related CVD
events.Similar trends were observed for hourly associations, where heart
rate pre-adjustment had had comparable effects on the outcomes.

The three studies demonstrate approaches to identifying CVD risk: (1)
selecting appropriate HRV indices, (2) segmenting time intervals, and
(3) assessing heart rate variability under defined conditions. Our
findings reveal varying associations across HRV indices, with RMSSD and
HF showing weaker associations. However, previous research has shown
that these indices can be informative when analyzed in 5-minute
segments\textsuperscript{124,132}. Additionally, SDNN exhibited varying
associations with CVD risk depending on the time of day. We also
observed that, in CARTs, the Valsalva maneuver and deep breathing test
were more indicative of heart failure. These insights highlight the need
for methodological rigor in HRV research, particularly in aligning index
selection and time segmentation with specific research objectives and
clinical contexts.

\hypertarget{cardiovascular-autonomic-reflex-test}{%
\subsubsection{Cardiovascular autonomic reflex
test}\label{cardiovascular-autonomic-reflex-test}}

CART provides a practical approach for screening for autonomic
dysfunction and has been shown to be a reliable
method\textsuperscript{133}. Although certain indices from CARTs may be
influenced by factors such as time of day or recent physical activity,
these effects are generally minimal. Furthermore, no impact of caffeine
intake has been observed on the reference age-based
formula\textsuperscript{65}. A limitation of the CARTs in this study was
the high prevalence of participants who were unable to complete the full
battery of tests, primarily due to missing data from the Valsalva
manoeuvre.

\hypertarget{measures-of-cardiovascular-risk}{%
\subsubsection{Measures of cardiovascular
risk}\label{measures-of-cardiovascular-risk}}

In study I, arterial stiffness measures, including pulse wave velocity
and carotid artery distensibility, are influenced by mean arterial
pressure (MAP), which may confound the assessment of vascular stiffness.
In Study I, we adjusted for MAP, which attenuated the observed
associations. However, the associations remained statistically
significant.

In Study II, outcomes were based on CVD events, heart failure, and
causes of death from Danish national registries. Potential
misclassification and underreporting, especially of heart failure, may
have led to underestimation of associations\textsuperscript{134}.

In Study III, NT-proBNP was used as a primary indicator of heart
failure. While NT-proBNP is a validated biomarker for early-stage heart
failure and useful for ruling out the condition, its specificity varies
by HF phenotype\textsuperscript{56}. Thus, we cannot determine HFpEF or
HFrEF. Its diagnostic accuracy is influenced by factors such as AF,
obesity, and kidney function\textsuperscript{56}. Individuals with AF
were excluded by design. Analysis was adjusted for BMI, which did not
affect the association between CAN and elevated NT-proBNP. After
adjusting for eGFR, the association became stronger, suggesting that
reduced kidney function may have masked the true link between CAN and
heart failure risk.

\hypertarget{external-validity}{%
\subsection{External validity}\label{external-validity}}

\hypertarget{selection-bias}{%
\subsubsection{Selection bias}\label{selection-bias}}

\textbf{The Maastricht Study}

The target population in Study I was intended to represent individuals
at different stages of glucose metabolism. However, our analysis may be
affected by selection bias in the representation of individuals with
T2D. The Maastricht Study recruited participants who were able and
willing to attend multiple research visits and receive personal health
feedback, which likely attracted health-conscious individuals with
higher education levels. As a result, participants with T2D were
relatively healthy, with a median disease duration of three years and a
low prevalence of complications. Those who completed both long-term ECG
and arterial stiffness assessments may represent an even healthier
subgroup. This selection bias may limit the generalizability of the
findings to the broader T2D population and could explain why the effect
modification did not differ step-wise from that observed in individuals
with prediabetes.

\textbf{ADDITION-PRO}

The target population in Study II was intended to represent individuals
at high risk of developing T2D. Participants were recruited through a
stepwise screening procedure. Initially, individuals were selected based
on a risk score derived from a self-administered questionnaire sent by
mail. Those with high scores were invited for further testing using
HbA1c or random glucose measurements.

This recruitment strategy involved selection by design, as it defined
the source population based on specific risk criteria. The questionnaire
prioritized risk factors such as older age and hypertension, leading to
overrepresentation of these groups\textsuperscript{135}. Prediabetes was
identified only after biochemical testing, while the risk score was
primarily designed to detect undiagnosed T2D. Although this selection
process was intentional and aligned with the ADDITION-PRO objectives, it
may limit the generalizability of the findings to the broader population
at risk for T2D.

In addition, selection bias may have occurred due to differential
participation in the ADDITION screening program. Healthier individuals
were more likely to participate, both by completing the risk
questionnaire and by attending follow-up testing\textsuperscript{136}.
As a result, the baseline risk for CVD in ADDITION-PRO participants may
have been lower compared to the target population.

\textbf{CANCAN}

The target population in Study III was intended to represent individuals
with type 2 diabetes treated in outpatient clinics. In Denmark, patients
with type 2 diabetes are referred to diabetes specialists at outpatient
clinics when their general practitioner is unable to stabilize their
condition. A strength of the CANCAN sampling strategy is that patients
were already attending endocrinology consultations, and the study
examination required only additional time during their visit, without
the need for extra transportation or appointments. Assessing selection
bias in this study is challenging, as inclusion depended on referral
practices by general practitioners\textsuperscript{137}. These practices
may vary individually, with differing thresholds for referring patients
to specialized care based on clinical judgment and patient
characteristics.

\hypertarget{generalisability}{%
\subsubsection{Generalisability}\label{generalisability}}

The generalisability of our findings is considered in the context of the
targeted recruitment strategies used in each study, which aimed to
include individuals across a spectrum of diabetes risk, from NGM to
established type 2 diabetes. As a result, the findings are most
applicable to populations with similar clinical profiles and healthcare
settings.

Studies I-III include individuals at high risk of diabetes and those
with T2D. Therefore, the associations between cardiovascular autonomic
dysfunction and cardiovascular outcomes or surrogate biomarkers are
relevant to individuals with some degree of diabetes risk and progressed
T2D. Study I suggests that the link between autonomic dysfunction and
cardiovascular risk, as measured by arterial stiffness, is also present
in individuals with NGM, though to a lesser extent. This finding,
supported by replication in the Whitehall II cohort\textsuperscript{90},
indicates that the observed relationship may extend beyond high-risk
groups and into the general population. In study III, participants
represent a higher-risk diabetes group among Danish diabetes patients,
while more stable patients remain under general practitioner care.
Consequently, the prevalence of heart failure indicators and CAN is
likely higher in this selected group, than patients managed in primary
care, and thus limits extending our finding to broader T2D populations.

By design, younger individuals with prediabetes or young-adult-onset
type 2 diabetes are underrepresented in our studies. This group may be
overlooked in current research and warrants further attention in future
studies\textsuperscript{128,138}. The applicability of our findings to
other countries may be influenced by differences in demographic
composition, risk factor distributions, healthcare systems, and stages
of economic development. These factors can affect both the prevalence of
diabetes and cardiovascular disease and the nature of their
associations. While our study populations were primarily of Nordic and
Western European descent, differences in ethnic composition are only one
of several factors that may influence external validity. These regions
also share relatively well-organized, publicly funded healthcare
systems, which may differ substantially from those in other parts of the
world and further affect the applicability of our findings.

\hypertarget{perspective}{%
\chapter{Perspective}\label{perspective}}

\newpage

This dissertation has investigated autonomic function impact on
cardiovascular complications across different stages of glucose
metabolism. Based on our findings and conclusions, we propose further
perspectives to define its role in research and healthcare from three
aspects: (1) continuous non-invasive health monitoring, (2) risk
stratification, and (3) identification as a causal and modifiable
marker.

\hypertarget{continuous-monitoring-of-cardiovascular-health}{%
\section{Continuous monitoring of cardiovascular
health}\label{continuous-monitoring-of-cardiovascular-health}}

Understanding when and how physiological signals reflect elevated CVD
risk is essential for developing early and effective prevention
strategies. Incorporating HRV into digital health solutions could
support personalized feedback mechanisms, enabling timely lifestyle or
therapeutic interventions and contributing to more adaptive and
preventive healthcare strategies. Digital CVD risk calculators can help
optimize the timing of follow-up assessments or the initiation of
treatment. In type 1 diabetes, for example, such tools are used to guide
decisions on starting lipid-lowering therapy. Similarly, recent analyses
at Steno Diabetes Center Copenhagen have shown that not all patients
require annual retinopathy screening. Instead, prediction models using
clinical variables can determine optimal re-screening intervals.
Wearable devices enable comprehensive data collection on behavioral
(e.g., sleep and physical activity) and physiological (e.g., heart rate,
ECG, temperature) parameters\textsuperscript{139}. These devices offer a
broader and more feasible approach to long-term heart rate monitoring.
Despite growing interest in wearable-based monitoring, the integration
of HRV into routine cardiometabolic risk assessment remains limited.

Two key aspects highlight the potential applications of monitoring: (1)
identification of risk and (2) assessment of response to intervention.

\emph{Identification of risk}

Lower long-term HRV is a risk factor for CVD, associated with arterial
stiffness and clinical endpoints. Our findings indicate that specific
HRV and heart rate patterns under free-living conditions may enhance
early risk detection, independent of concurrent physical activity. For
improved risk assessment, future predictive models should move beyond
adjusting for physical activity as a confounder and instead integrate
multiple physiological signals, such as HRV responses to sleep and
activity patterns, to better capture dynamic health states. Machine
learning offers powerful tools to analyze complex raw time-series data,
including interbeat intervals and accelerometer signals, potentially
improving risk prediction beyond traditional HRV summary metrics.
However, the limited interpretability of these models remains a key
barrier to clinical adoption.

\emph{Assessment of response to intervention}

HRV represents a potential target for intervention, as low HRV may
reflect adverse lifestyle patterns. Behaviors such as disrupted sleep,
physical inactivity, and irregular meal timing can influence circadian
fluctuations in HRV (ref. sleep, activity)\textsuperscript{124}.
Pharmacological interventions also impact HRV: beta-blockers have been
shown to increase HRV, while GLP-1 receptor agonists may reduce it
{[}\textsuperscript{131}{]}\textsuperscript{140}.

interventions. (Source: Author)}

\end{minipage}%

\end{figure}

Future research can leverage wearable devices to monitor the
effectiveness of behavioral and pharmacological interventions on HRV at
the individual level. This approach may support precision real-time
monitoring to identify lifestyle patterns or treatments that promote
cardiovascular health through HRV modulation or uncover potential side
effects\textsuperscript{141}.

However, standardization and transparency across wearable device brands
remain a challenge for both research and clinical use. While
smartwatches offer convenient heart rate monitoring, their accuracy
varies due to reliance on photoplethysmography, which can be affected by
motion and other external factors, especially during physical activity
{[}\textsuperscript{142}{]}\textsuperscript{143}. Despite these
limitations, ongoing improvements in sensor technology and algorithm
calibration are likely to enhance the reliability of wearable-derived
HRV and heart rate data. Open data formats are important to ensure that
detailed data (e.g.~interbeat intervals) from various devices can be
used consistently in health prediction algorithms, rather than relying
only on summarized outputs.

\hypertarget{risk-stratification-1}{%
\section{Risk-stratification}\label{risk-stratification-1}}

The distinct roles of long-term HRV and CART in cardiovascular risk
stratification remain to be fully established. From a wearable
technology perspective, long-term HRV offers two promising avenues that
warrant further investigation:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Non-invasive risk identification: HRV measured via wearable devices
  may help identify individuals at elevated cardiovascular risk without
  the need for invasive measures such as blood pressure readings or
  blood samples.
\item
  Enhancement of existing risk scores: HRV may improve the predictive
  accuracy of established cardiovascular risk models, such as SCORE2 or
  the Framingham Risk Score.
\end{enumerate}

Both applications require further research to determine their clinical
utility and integration into routine risk assessment.

A key limitation of long-term HRV measurement is the lack of
standardization, as data collected under free-living conditions may be
influenced by daily behaviors, potentially affecting risk
classification. This highlights the need for standardized protocols. In
contrast, CART is a reliable, non-invasive method that typically takes
around 10 minutes to perform. A standardized and validated diagnosis of
CAN using CART may help identify individuals with T2D who are at
elevated risk of complications. However, the extent to which CAN
diagnosis predicts heart failure risk and applies to broader populations
with T2D or prediabetes remains to be clarified.

Our findings suggest that long-term HRV and CAN may serve as useful
markers for identifying individuals at elevated metabolic risk who could
benefit from targeted preventive strategies. Future research should
explore whether identifying individuals as high-risk based on autonomic
dysfunction or CAN could support personalized and timely cardiovascular
screening or interventions\textsuperscript{141}.

\section{Effective causal modifiable
marker}\label{effective-causal-modifiable-marker}}

Our findings support a potential etiological link between long-term HRV
and CVD risk, providing preliminary evidence consistent with a causal
relationship. However, the observed association does not confirm
causality, and further research is needed to determine whether HRV
directly influences CVD outcomes. While randomized controlled trials are
the gold standard for establishing causality, isolating the direct
effect of HRV is particularly challenging. Interventions that affect HRV
often do so indirectly through changes in weight, inflammation, or
insulin sensitivity. Similarly, pharmacological treatments may improve
HRV as a secondary effect, such as through blood pressure reduction from
antihypertensive medications. This makes it difficult to determine
whether modifying HRV itself leads to improved cardiovascular outcomes.

To address these limitations, modern epidemiological methods such as
Mendelian randomization and structured causal mediation analysis offer
promising alternatives. These approaches can help infer causality from
observational data and estimate indirect effects using trial data.
Notably, no GWAS has yet investigated the genetic determinants of
long-term HRV. Establishing such associations is essential for
understanding its genetic architecture and for using genetic variants as
unconfounded proxies to assess HRV's causal role in CVD. However, a
challenge arises from findings in short-term HRV, which show
considerable pleiotropy. This may complicate the use of Mendelian
randomization, as the method relies on the assumption of no horizontal
pleiotropy\textsuperscript{144}.

Future cardiometabolic intervention trials and longitudinal cohorts,
whether focused on lifestyle or pharmacological strategies, should,
where feasible, include repeated HRV measurements measurements. This
would enable structured mediation analyses and help determine whether
modifying autonomic function leads to sustained improvements in
cardiovascular outcomes. Such evidence could clarify whether
interventions like antihypertensive medications or lifestyle changes in
physical activity, diet, and sleep can causally and sustainably improve
CVD risk through HRV modulation.

\chapter{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}}

\newpage

This dissertation aimed to investigate how autonomic dysfunction,
assessed by HRV and CARTs, is associated with cardiovascular
complications across different stages of glucose metabolism. The
findings support the hypothesis that autonomic dysfunction is an early
and independent marker of cardiovascular risk.

Autonomic dysfunction was associated with higher arterial stiffness not
only in individuals with T2D, but also in those with prediabetes and
normal glucose metabolism. A particularly pronounced association was
observed in individuals with prediabetes, where lower multiday HRV was
linked to a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and
mortality. These findings suggest that autonomic dysfunction may
contribute to cardiovascular complications even before the onset of T2D,
potentially through a modifying effect during the early stages of
dysglycemia. Among individuals with T2D, standardized CARTs identified
those with CAN who had a higher risk of heart failure, even when
asymptomatic and not classified as high risk by risk scores.

Early detection is important, as CVD and heart failure are associated
with reduced life expectancy and quality of life. This dissertation
demonstrates the potential of autonomic dysfunction as a clinically
relevant marker of cardiovascular risk across the full spectrum of
glucose metabolism, including stages prior to the onset of T2D. However,
it remains unclear whether this dysfunction plays a causal role or
reflects underlying pathophysiological processes. Further research is
needed to determine its clinical utility in risk stratification and its
potential as a target for intervention.

This dissertation investigated whether cardiovascular autonomic
dysfunction is associated with cardiovascular complications in
individuals with normal glucose metabolism, prediabetes, and type 2
diabetes. Cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction was assessed using heart
rate variability and standardized cardiovascular autonomic reflex tests.
Among the measures, 24-hour heart rate variability reflected autonomic
balance and circadian shifts in sympathetic and parasympathetic
activity. Lower long-term heart rate variability was consistently
associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes.

Across three studies, autonomic dysfunction was linked to higher levels
of arterial stiffness, a higher incidence of ischemic cardiovascular
events, heart failure, and all-cause mortality. The association with
arterial stiffness was observed across the full spectrum of glucose
metabolism and was particularly pronounced in individuals with
prediabetes, suggesting that autonomic dysfunction may play a role early
in the pathophysiological process. Building on this, the subsequent
studies focused on individuals at high risk of developing diabetes. In
this population, cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction was associated
with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and
mortality.

Cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy, as identified through abnormal
cardiovascular reflex testing, was associated with a higher risk of
heart failure, even in individuals without symptoms. These findings
suggest that cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction may serve as an early
and independent marker of heart failure risk, particularly in
populations at risk of type 2 diabetes.

The dissertation concludes that cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction is
a clinically relevant risk factor that warrants further attention in
both research and clinical practice. Future studies should explore
whether improving autonomic function can reduce cardiovascular risk and
whether measures of autonomic dysfunction can be integrated into
existing risk models. Additionally, the potential of wearable
technologies for continuous monitoring and early detection is a
possibility to be evaluated in both clinical and general populations.

Denne afhandling undersøgte, om kardiovaskulær autonom dysfunktion er
forbundet med kardiovaskulære komplikationer hos personer med normal
glukosemetabolisme, prædiabetes og type 2-diabetes. Kardiovaskulær
autonom dysfunktion blev målt igennme hjeretrymevariabilitet (HRV) og
standardiserede kardiovaskulære autonome refleksundersøgelser (CARTs).
Blandt målingerne gav 24-timers HRV indsigt i den autonome balance og
døgnrytmens skift mellem sympatisk og parasympatisk aktivitet. Lavere
værdier var konsekvent forbundet med ugunstige kardiovaskulære udfald.

På tværs af tre studier blev autonom dysfunktion forbundet med højere
niveauer af arteriel stivhed, en højere forekomst af iskæmiske
hjertekarsygedom, hjertesvigt og dødelighed. Sammenhængen med arteriel
stivhed blev observeret på tværs af hele spektret af glukosemetabolisme
og var særligt forhøjet hos personer med prædiabetes, hvilket antyder,
at autonom dysfunktion. På baggrund af dette fokuserede det
efterfølgende studie på personer med høj risiko for at udvikle diabetes.
I denne population var kardiovaskulær autonom dysfunktion forbundet med
højere risiko for kardiovaskulær sygdom, hjertesvigt og dødelighed.

Kardiovaskulær autonom neuropati, defineret gennem abnormale CARTs, var
forbundet med en højere risiko for hjertesvigt hos individer med type 2
diabetes, selv hos personer uden symptomer. Disse fund tyder på, at
kardiovaskulær autonom dysfunktion kan fungere som en tidlig og
uafhængig markør for risikoen for hjertesvigt, især i populationer med
risiko for type 2-diabetes.

Afhandlingen konkluderer, at kardiovaskulær autonom dysfunktion er en
klinisk relevant risikofaktor, som bør tiltrække større opmærksomhed i
både forskning og klinisk praksis. Fremtidige studier bør undersøge, om
forbedring af autonom funktion kan reducere kardiovaskulær risiko, og om
målinger af autonom dysfunktion kan integreres i eksisterende
risikomodeller. Derudover er potentialet i smarture til kontinuerlig
overvågning og tidlig opsporing en mulighed, der kan vurderes i både
kliniske og generelle populationer.
