# Preface {#sec-preface .unnumbered}

The research presented in this dissertation was conducted during my PhD studies at the Department of Public Health, Aarhus University, and Steno Diabetes Center Aarhus, between 2022 and 2025. The project was supported by the Department of Public Health at Aarhus University, Steno Diabetes Center Aarhus, and the European Foundation for the Study of Diabetes/Sanofi European Diabetes Research Programme in Diabetes associated with Cardiovascular Disease. The aim was to better understand the impact of cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction on heart disease in individuals with diabetes. I am grateful for the opportunity to explore how autonomic dysfunction can be demonstrated by investigating variations in heart rate responses across different durations and conditions to gain insights into cardiovascular risk, which remains ongoing issue in current research. It is my hope that the findings of this dissertation will contribute to a deeper understanding of the clinical potential of long-term heart rate variability measures and standardized cardiovascular autonomic tests in identifying individuals at risk for cardiovascular disease across all stages of glucose metabolism. In doing so, I hope this work contributes to the broader effort of improving care for individuals at risk of developing diabetes, as well as those already living with the condition.

# Other work and collaboration during the PhD {#sec-preface .unnumbered}

Much of the work I have been involved in during my PhD is not fully reflected in this dissertation. I would like to take this opportunity to provide an overview and acknowledge the many collaborative establishment that sprouted during my time as a PhD student.

In my work on diabetes epidemiology, I have been deeply curious about the future methods in research. This led me to become a peripheral member of the Hulman Lab, a group with an open heart and a strong foundation in critical thinking, focused on machine learning and clinical prediction. Together with Adam Hulman and Anders Isaksen, we investigated how people perceive the use of artificial intelligence in healthcare. On this project, I am grateful to Lasse Bjerg and Annelli Sandbæk and rest of Health Central Denmark (HICD) steering comitees for integrating our questionnaire into their cohort, which greatly supported our quest. I also appreciate Kasper Normann’s help with prompt data management. This collaboration resulted in one original research paper and two preprints based on two waves of data collection from the HICD cohort.

In this PhD project, we set out to extend the generalisability of the CANCAN findings to populations without type 2 diabetes. This led us to use data from the Lolland-Falster Health Study (LOFUS). I am deeply grateful to Randi Jepsen for the collaboration on accessing the cohort and for her support in getting the biobank samples analysed. The data is now ready for use in the study. Further appreciation goes to Marie Mathilde Bjerg Christensen, Christian Stevns Hansen, and Jesper Fleischer for updating reference values for CARTs using LOFUS data and for generously sharing their expertise on the measurements.

In my last year of the PhD is was lucky to exchange research environment to Baker Heart and Diabetes Institute. I had the privilege of working alongside a proficient team of epidemiologists consisting of PhD students, postdoctoral researchers, and senior scientists, using data from the PREDICT study involving patients with type 2 diabetes. I was impressed by how closely research and clinical care are integrated. Furthermore, their dedication to utilizing cohorts and organizing multinational data resources was truly admirable. I would like to extend a special thank to Professor Dianna Magliano, Senior Researcher Julian Sacre, and Professor Jonathan Shaw for their valuable input on using questionnaires to screen for heart failure subtypes and for helping to shape a study that will be submitted soon.
