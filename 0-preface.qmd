# Preface {#sec-preface .unnumbered}

This dissertation presents research conducted during my PhD studies at the Department of Public Health, Aarhus University, and Steno Diabetes Center Aarhus between 2022 and 2025. The project was generously supported by the Department of Public Health at Aarhus University, Steno Diabetes Center Aarhus, and the European Foundation for the Study of Diabetes Sanofi European Diabetes Research Programme in Diabetes associated with Cardiovascular Disease.
The primary aim of this work was to deepen our understanding of how cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction contributes to heart disease in individuals with diabetes or those at high risk of diabetes. I am grateful for the opportunity to explore how autonomic dysfunction can be assessed through variations in heart rate responses under different durations and conditions, offering insights into cardiovascular risk, which remains a significant concern in current research.
I hope the findings of this dissertation contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the clinical potential of long-term heart rate variability measures and standardized cardiovascular autonomic reflex tests. Ultimately, I aspire for this work to support the broader goal of improving care for individuals at risk of or living with diabetes.


# Other work and collaboration during the PhD {#sec-preface .unnumbered}

Much of the work I have been involved in during my PhD is not fully reflected in this dissertation. I would like to take this opportunity to provide an overview and acknowledge the many collaborative efforts that emerged during my time as a PhD student.

At the beginning of my PhD, I finalized and published my first work on heart rate variability, as a continuation of the research from my master’s thesis using data from the Whitehall II cohort. I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Adam Hulman, Dorte Vistisen, and Adam Tabák for their valuable contributions and support in bringing this work to completion.

In my work on diabetes epidemiology, I have been deeply curious about future methods in research. This led me to become a peripheral member of the Hulman Lab, a group with an open heart and a strong foundation in critical thinking, focused on machine learning and clinical prediction. Together with Adam Hulman and Anders Isaksen, we investigated how people perceive the use of artificial intelligence in healthcare. On this project, I am grateful to Lasse Bjerg, Annelli Sandbæk, and the rest of the Health in Central Denmark (HICD) steering committee for integrating our questionnaire into their cohort. I also appreciate Kasper Normann’s help with timely data management. This collaboration resulted in one original research paper and two other submitted manuscripts based on wave 2022 and 2024 of data collection from the HICD cohort.

We set out to extend the generalisability of the CANCAN findings to populations without type 2 diabetes. This led us to use data from the Lolland-Falster Health Study (LOFUS). I am deeply grateful to Randi Jepsen for the collaboration on accessing the cohort and for her support in getting the biobank samples analysed. The data is now ready for use in the study. Further appreciation goes to Marie Mathilde Bjerg Christensen, Christian Stevns Hansen, and Jesper Fleischer for updating reference values for cardiovascular reflex tests using LOFUS data and for generously sharing their expertise on the measurements.

In my last year of the PhD, I was fortunate to exchange research environments with the Baker Heart and Diabetes Institute. I had the privilege of working alongside a proficient team of epidemiologists consisting of PhD students, postdoctoral researchers, and senior scientists, using data from the PREDICT study involving patients with type 2 diabetes. I was impressed by how closely research and clinical care are integrated. Furthermore, their dedication to utilizing cohorts and organizing multinational data resources was truly admirable. I would like to extend a special thank you to Professor Dianna Magliano, Senior Researcher Julian Sacre, and Professor Jonathan Shaw for their valuable input on using questionnaires to screen for heart failure subtypes and for helping to shape a study that will be submitted soon.
