# Preface {#sec-preface .unnumbered}

The research presented in this dissertation was conducted during my PhD studies at the Department of Public Health, Aarhus University, and Steno Diabetes Center Aarhus, between 2022 and 2025. The project was supported by the Department of Public Health at Aarhus University, Steno Diabetes Center Aarhus, and the European Foundation for the Study of Diabetes/Sanofi European Diabetes Research Programme in Diabetes associated with Cardiovascular Disease. The aim was to better understand the impact of cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction on heart disease in individuals with diabetes. I am grateful for the opportunity to explore how autonomic dysfunction can be demonstrated by investigating variations in heart rate responses across different durations and conditions to gain insights into cardiovascular risk, which remains ongoing issue in current research. It is my hope that the findings of this dissertation will contribute to a deeper understanding of the clinical potential of long-term heart rate variability measures and standardized cardiovascular autonomic tests in identifying individuals at risk for cardiovascular disease across all stages of glucose metabolism. In doing so, I hope this work contributes to the broader effort of improving care for individuals at risk of developing diabetes, as well as those already living with the condition.
